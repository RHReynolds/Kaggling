    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers). Currently this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a very time-consuming task where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature. For this competition MSKCC is making available an expert-annotated knowledge base where world-class researchers and oncologists have manually annotated thousands of mutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Problem statement:** Use machine learning to create a model that classifies genetic mutations based on clinical evidence (text).\n",

    "- **training_variants** - a comma separated file containing the description of the genetic mutations used for training. Fields are ID (the id of the row used to link the mutation to the clinical evidence), Gene (the gene where this genetic mutation is located), Variation (the aminoacid change for this mutations), Class (1-9 the class this genetic mutation has been classified on)\n",
    "- **training_text** - a double pipe (||) delimited file that contains the clinical evidence (text) used to classify genetic mutations. Fields are ID (the id of the row used to link the clinical evidence to the genetic mutation), Text (the clinical evidence used to classify the genetic mutation)\n",

       "                &lt;th&gt;The PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) phosphatase is unique in mammals in terms of its tumor suppressor activity, exerted by dephosphorylation of the lipid second messenger PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate), which activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) oncogenic pathway. Loss-of-function mutations in the PTEN gene are frequent in human cancer and in the germline of patients with PTEN hamartoma tumor-related syndromes (PHTSs). In addition, PTEN is mutated in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), although no functional information on these mutations is available. Here, we report a comprehensive in vivo functional analysis of human PTEN using a heterologous yeast reconstitution system. Ala-scanning mutagenesis at the catalytic loops of PTEN outlined the critical role of residues within the P-catalytic loop for PIP3 phosphatase activity in vivo. PTEN mutations that mimic the P-catalytic loop of mammalian PTEN-like proteins (TPTE, TPIP, tensins and auxilins) affected PTEN function variably, whereas tumor- or PHTS-associated mutations targeting the PTEN P-loop produced complete loss of function. Conversely, Ala-substitutions, as well as tumor-related mutations at the WPD- and TI-catalytic loops, displayed partial activity in many cases. Interestingly, a tumor-related D92N mutation was partially active, supporting the notion that the PTEN Asp92 residue might not function as the catalytic general acid. The analysis of a panel of ASD-associated hereditary PTEN mutations revealed that most of them did not substantially abrogate PTEN activity in vivo, whereas most of PHTS-associated mutations did. Our findings reveal distinctive functional patterns among PTEN mutations found in tumors and in the germline of PHTS and ASD patients, which could be relevant for therapy. Topic: mutation catalysis phosphoric monoester hydrolases yeasts neoplasms pten gene Issue Section: Articles INTRODUCTION  PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10) is a mammalian lipid and protein phosphatase with orthologs in lower animals, plants and fungi (1). In mammals, PTEN-related proteins exist whose activity has been poorly explored. These proteins include TPIP and TPTE (orthologs of a voltage-sensor phosphatase from Ciona intestinalis), as well as the actin-binding tensin 1/2/3 and the clathrin-binding auxilin 1/2 (2â€“4). PTEN most relevant function is based on its ability to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) in the 3â€² phosphate of the inositol ring, resulting in the bisphosphate product phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), thus broadly inhibiting the oncogenic phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent signaling (5â€“8). As a tumor suppressor, PTEN exerts its function by counteracting the anti-apoptotic and growth stimulatory effects of PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase) and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), which rely on PIP3 for their activation (9,10). Sporadic somatic mutations in PTEN make this tumor suppressor gene one of the two most frequently affected in human malignancies, together with p53, especially in solid tumors (11â€“14). Germline mutations of PTEN lead to inherited hamartoma, Cowden syndrome and related disorders, generally known as PTEN hamartoma tumor-related syndromes (PHTSs) (15â€“17). PTEN is considered haploinsufficient to prevent certain malignancies, suggesting that dosage is important for its function, as it must be the influence of a given point mutation in the catalytic activity of the enzyme (18). Besides its clear involvement in PHTS, germline PTEN mutations have been described in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and developmental delay (DD) (19â€“22). Oncogenic PTEN mutations have been generally related to a loss of function of the encoded phosphatase. However, few studies have been done to understand the influence of putative neurodevelopment-related PTEN mutations on its catalytic activity.  Although phosphatase-independent functions of PTEN have also been described to contribute to its tumor suppressive activity (8,23â€“25), buffering PI3K signaling in virtue of its catalytic activity is assumed to be its key role. Thus, the precise dissection of PTEN catalytic properties is highly relevant for human disease. The crystal structure of PTEN (26) revealed an active site pocket similar to those of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and dual-specificity Thr/Ser/Tyr phosphatases, as predicted by primary sequence analyses, although richer in basic residues. This explained the ability of PTEN to dephosphorylate acidic phosphopeptides (27). In addition, the PTEN active site pocket was wider than that of PTPs, to accommodate the rather bulky phosphorylated inositol moiety that constitutes the polar head of PIP3 (26). The PTEN phosphatase signature motif ([123]HCKAGKGR[130]; P-loop), including the catalytic Cys124 and Arg130 residues, is located at the bottom of the active site pocket. The walls of the pocket are delimited in part by a WPD-loop (thus designed after the equivalent region in PTP1B) and a TI-loop (so named because of conserved Thr and Ile residues), which are thought to be important for the activity of the enzyme. The fact that the Asp92, within the PTEN WPD-loop, is located in the pocket in an identical fashion to the equivalent proton donor catalytic residue on PTP1B led to the hypothesis that it may serve as the general acid that allows protonation of the leaving phosphate during the dephosphorylation reaction. Although in vitro studies using an Asp92 to Ala PTEN mutation indicated that Asp92 does not act as the general acid (28,29), no conclusive studies have been done to analyze the contribution of Asp92 in the in vivo dephosphorylation of PIP3 by PTEN.  We have previously validated a humanized yeast model to study the function of PI3K and PTEN in vivo, based on the heterologous co-expression of these proteins (1,30,31). Briefly, expression of hyperactive p110Î±, the catalytic subunit of mammalian class I PI3K, results in high toxicity in yeast cells as a result of the depletion of essential PIP2 pools. Co-expression of PTEN restores PIP2 levels and suppresses PI3K toxicity. Besides, co-expression of GFP-tagged mammalian Akt in this system allowed the detection of pools of PI3K-generated PIP3 in the yeast cell, where Akt localized, providing a visual readout of PI3K and PTEN activities (30,32). Here, we present an extensive site-directed mutagenesis and functional study of PTEN by using this system. Humanized yeast-based bioassays combine the advantages of powerful yeast genetics, an ever-growing availability of post-genomic tools, their ease and safety of manipulation and the fast achievement of results (1). Our results offer insights into the catalytic properties of PTEN and provide a platform to compare in vivo the contribution to lipid phosphatase inactivation of mutations found in tumors and in the germline of patients with PTEN-related syndromes. Our analysis reveals that PTEN germline mutations found in patients with ASD/DD neurodevelopmental disorders do not generally confer complete loss of function of the PTEN PIP3 phosphatase activity, when compared with mutations found in the germline of PHTS patients with tumor disorders.  RESULTS  Ala-scanning of the catalytic loops at the PTEN active site  The PIP3 lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN is essential for its tumor suppressor activity, which is evidenced by the abundance of tumor-related mutations in exons encoding the catalytic phosphatase core of the enzyme (11,15,33). Thus, the precise definition of PIP3 catalytic properties of PTEN in vivo, and its relation with PTEN residues mutated in tumor samples or in patients, is highly relevant in oncology. The PTEN active site is conformed by three catalytic loops (26): the WPD-loop, residues 88â€“98; the P-loop, residues 121â€“131; and the TI-loop, residues 160â€“171 (Fig. 1A). The P-catalytic loop (containing the essential catalytic cysteine; Cys124 in human PTEN) is highly conserved between species, from mammals to lower eukaryotes, whereas the WPD- and TI-loops are more divergent (Fig. 1B). To test the contribution of all individual residues within the three PTEN catalytic loops to the in vivo activity of the enzyme, a comprehensive Ala-scanning mutagenesis was performed. The PIP3 catalytic activity of the resulting mutations was assessed in vivo using a reconstitution heterologous system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (31). As illustrated in Figure 2, Ala substitutions of the residues at the core P-loop (residues 121â€“131) substantially abrogated the PTEN ability to dephosphorylate PIP3in vivo, with the exception of the A121V, G129A and T131A mutations, which displayed partial or total activity (note that Ala residues have been substituted by Val residues in our Ala-scanning mutational analysis). Remarkably, a Cowden disease mutation targeting the Gly129 residue (G129E) is defective for PIP3 phosphatase activity but maintains in vitro activity against phosphotyrosine peptides (34). Overall, the residues at the WPD- and TI-loops were less important for PIP3 catalytic activity. Thus, Ala substitutions of most WPD residues (88â€“98) did not affect, or only partially affected, PTEN catalytic activity, with the exception of Asp92 and His93 that fully abrogated the PTEN function (Fig. 2). Also, Ala substitutions of most TI residues (160â€“171) only weakly affected the PTEN activity, except for Val166, Gln171 and, to some extent, Asp162. (Fig. 2) The loss-of-function properties of the D92A mutation is in accordance with the importance of this residue in PTEN phosphatase catalysis, although its role as the general acid in the hydrolysis reaction remains unclear (28,29).

Functional analysis of mutations at the PTEN P-loop mimicking PTEN-like proteins  PTEN-like proteins include TPIP and TPTE, as well as tensins and auxilins. The WPD- and TI-loops are divergent between PTEN and PTEN-like proteins, whereas the P-loop is more conserved (Fig. 1C). As part of our mutational analysis of the PTEN active site, we designed single amino acid substitution mutants on PTEN that mimicked the P-loop from the different PTEN-like proteins and tested their PIP3 phosphatase activity in the yeast system. Mutations included A121V, I122L, I122V, H123Y, C124N, K125L, K125M, K125R, A126D, A126G, G127N, K128R, K128T, G129D, G129A, R130A, R130K, T131I, T131L and T131S (note that A121V, G129A and R130A mutations are included in Fig. 2). A group of mutations (H123Y, C124N, A126D, G127N, K128T, G129D, R130A, R130K, T131I and T131L) fully abrogated the PIP3 phosphatase activity of PTEN in yeast, whereas other two groups only affected partially (I122L, K125L, K125M, A126G and K128R) or did not affect PTEN PIP3 phosphatase activity (A121V, I122V, K125R, G129A and T131S) (Fig. 3; note that results for A121V, G129A and R130A mutations are included in Fig. 2). The results from this mutational analysis are in agreement with the in vitro PIP3 phosphatase activity reported for TPIP and with the lack of activity reported for TPTE (35). Our results also suggest that the P-loops from tensin and auxilin proteins do not bear catalytic activity. Moreover, this analysis revealed that some conservative mutations at the PTEN P-loop (such as I122V, K125R and T131S) are permissive for its activity in vivo.  Figure 3.

Functional analysis of tumor-related mutations targeting PTEN active site residues  Tumor-related mutations are spread along the entire PTEN amino acid sequence. Nevertheless, the PTEN C-terminal tail (last 50 residues) is targeted by mutations less frequently, in agreement with our previous finding using the yeast heterologous system that PTEN 1â€“349 is the minimal fully functional PTEN protein (30). On the other hand, the core PTP catalytic domain (residues 14â€“185) is more frequently targeted by mutations in either tumors or PHTS patients. Some of these mutations have been analyzed in terms of intrinsic catalytic activity (36â€“40), but the majority of them have not been directly tested for function. We have analyzed in the yeast system the PIP3 phosphatase activity of tumor-related mutations targeting PTEN residues at the PTEN catalytic loops (note that some of these mutations have been analyzed previously and are shown in Figs 2 and 3; and Figs 5 and 6 also include some of them). As expected, all the tumor mutations at the P-loop tested (A121E, I122S, H123D, H123Y, C124S, K125E, A126S, A126V, G127E, K128N, G129E, G129V, G129R, R130G, T131A and T131I) gave rise to proteins that were fully inactive, except for A126S and K128N that produced partially inactive proteins (Fig. 4 and Figs 2 and 3). Mutations at the TI-loop included T160I, R161G, D162G, G165E, G165V, V166I, T167A, I168F, P169H and S170R. Among these, only the T160I, G165E, G165V and S170R were loss-of-function mutations (Fig. 4 and Fig. 2). Finally, tumor-related mutations targeting the WPD loop included Y88C, F90L, E91A, D92A, D92E, D92G, D92H, D92N, D92V, H93D, H93Q, H93R, H93Y, N94I, P95L and P96Q. Proteins bearing Y88C, F90L or E91A mutations were active, whereas the rest of mutant proteins were partially or fully inactive (Fig. 4 and Figs 2, 5 and 6). A summary of the tumor-related PTEN mutants analyzed is shown in Supplementary Material, Table S1. Taken together, our findings illustrate the heterogeneity in the catalytic activity of tumor-related PTEN mutant proteins.  Figure 4.

Relevance of the Asp92 residue in PTEN activity in vivo  Remarkably, a mutation in the putative catalytic Asp92 residue to Asn (D92N) rendered a protein partially active in vivo in the yeast system, whereas substitution of this residue to any of the other 18 amino acids generated fully inactive PTEN enzymes (Fig. 5A). This outlines the importance of Asp92 in PTEN enzymatic activity, but also demonstrates that the presence of an aspartic acid residue at this position is not a strict requirement for PTEN-driven catalysis. To further substantiate this observation, the PIP3 phosphatase activity of the PTEN mutations D92A (non-conservative), D92E (charge-conservative) and D92N (size-conservative), expressed in mammalian cells, was tested both in vitro and in vivo. As shown, the mutations D92A and D92E fully abrogated hydrolysis of PIP3 by PTEN in vitro, whereas the mutation D92N only partially affected it (Fig. 5B). Upon co-expression with Akt, the D92N PTEN mutant also manifested more activity [indirectly measured as the levels of phospho-Akt (p-Akt) content] than the D92A or the D92E mutant proteins (Fig. 5C). Our results suggest that Asp92 does not behave as the general acid in the hydrolysis of PIP3 by PTEN, in vitro and in vivo.  Most of germline PTEN mutations associated with autism syndrome disorders do not fully abrogate PIP3 phosphatase activity  The involvement of PTEN in brain developmental disorders has been proposed on the basis of the identification of hereditary PTEN mutations in patients with these disorders (41,42), but little information is available on the severity of such mutations in terms of PTEN function. One of the mutations present in glioblastoma tumor samples (H93R) has also been found in the germline of a patient with autism (19). When performing the experiments shown above on tumor-related PTEN mutations, we included the H93R and found it to display a modest loss of activity in the yeast model when compared with wild-type PTEN, although it was capable of fully recovering yeast growth (Fig. 6B). This prompted us to examine additional inherited mutations found in patients with autism-related disorders (ASD) or with DD/mental retardation. These mutations included, besides H93R, the G44D, H118P, H123Q, M134T, E157G, R173H, Y176C, T202I, F241S, D252G, W274L, N276S and D326N, involving not only catalytic but other protein domains. Remarkably, proteins bearing most of these mutations were either fully or partially active in the yeast (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Material, Table S1), although their ability to recover growth from PI3K-imposed inhibition was variable. These results were in contrast to those obtained by analyzing the function of a panel of PHTS-associated mutations, also distributed along the entire PTEN coding region (mutations A34D, M35R, G36R, N48K, H61D, Y68D, D92E, H93Y, P96Q, H123D, C124S, G129E, R130G, Y155C, G165E, G165V, S170R, L181P, V217N, P246L, R335L, V343E; L345V and F347L; Fig. 6A and Supplementary Material, Table S1). Most of the PHTS-associated mutations generated total or partial loss of function when analyzed in vivo in yeast. Moreover, global comparison of PHTS- and ASD/DD-related mutations in terms of their ability both to deplete PIP3 generated by PI3K in yeast (Fig. 6C; P &amp;lt; 0.001) and to rescue yeast growth (Fig. 6D) revealed that ASD/DD-related PTEN mutations have a lower effect in PTEN activity than those associated with PHTS. These findings indicate that specific PTEN functional patterns correlate with the mutations found on either PHTS or ASD/DD patients and suggest that a severe loss of the PTEN PIP3 catalytic activity may not be the major driver of autism or autism-related neurological disorders.  DISCUSSION  The PTEN phosphatase is a key regulatory hub of PI3K-mediated signaling. While mammals express a variety of isoforms of PI3K and PIP3-dependent downstream kinases in this pathway, the PTEN tumor suppressor is rather unique, being the only one gene that encodes for a common inactivator of the pathway. Thus, mutations in exons of the PTEN gene are frequent in tumors and hereditary cancer syndromes. The regulation of PTEN is complex, involving multiple processes related to its phosphorylation, ubiquitination, nuclear translocation, interaction with membranes and complexing with different proteins (6,8,24,43,44). Although recent reports point towards PTEN functions independent of its lipid phosphatase activity (23â€“25,45,46), PTEN tumor suppressor function mainly relies on its catalytic activity on PIP3 pools locally generated by PI3K at the plasma membrane. The contribution of PTEN mutations isolated in the clinics to the function of the encoded protein is crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms that lead to tumor development and progression. We have developed a simple model for functional assessment of PTEN mutations based on heterologous expression in yeast (1,31). This model allows ready evaluation of the involvement of PTEN mutations on the ability to counteract PI3K activity in vivo, by compromising PTEN PIP3 catalytic activity or by affecting PTEN protein stability, two common mechanisms by which PTEN is inactivated in tumors (30). Here, we report extensive use of this model with two aims: (i) to provide clues for structureâ€“function relationship by systematic mutagenesis and (ii) to study the influence of individual disease-related PTEN mutations in its lipid phosphatase activity.  From our systematic functional analysis on the PTEN catalytic loops, several conclusions can be driven. First, as expected, the P-loop including the catalytic Cys residue is very sensitive to mutagenesis, in consonance with the observation that it constitutes a hot spot for tumor-related mutations (11,15,33), whereas the WPD and TI loops are more permissive to point Ala substitutions. Still, residues like Asp92 or His93 (WPD-loop), Asp162, Val166 or Gln171 (TI-loop) were critical for function. We made a comprehensive study on tolerance to mutation of the Asp92 residue, equivalent to the acid proton donor involved in catalysis in PTPs that are structurally related to PTEN (47). Tolerance to mutation was very low in this residue, since its substitution to any other amino acid yielded an inactive enzyme, except for Asp-to-Asn substitution, which partially retained activity in vivo, not only in the yeast model but also in mammalian cells. Since the D92N mutation has been reported in the clinic, such reduced activity may substantially contribute to disease. Interestingly, this argues against the need for an acid residue in that position, revealing an alternative mechanism of catalysis for the PTEN phosphatase, as proposed by other authors based on in vitro experiments (28,29). We also made substitutions within the catalytic loops mimicking PTEN-related proteins, such as TPIP, TPTE, tensin and auxilin. Although these proteins possess distinct non-PTP-related domains that control protein targeting, proteinâ€“protein interactions and cell signaling, they share the presence of PTP- and C2-like domains with significant similarity with those from PTEN (2,3,48). With the exception of TPIP, PTEN-like proteins are predicted to be catalytically inactive, due either to the lack of essential residues at the catalytic site or to amino acid substitutions potentially deleterious for catalysis (35,49,50). Nevertheless, tensin2/C1-TEN has been proposed to be an active phosphatase, based on functional studies on a mutation that targets its putative catalytic cysteine residue (51). Our observations favor the hypothesis that the P-loop of TPIP might be competent for activity, whereas TPTE, tensins and auxilins would be inactive as phosphatases, as evidenced in other studies (35,52,53).  A large number of different PTEN mutations have been described in human tumors and in the germline of patients with PHTS or PHTS-related syndromes (11,15,33) [for updates, check HGMD (http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php) and COSMIC (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic) databases]. These mutations target the PTEN gene not only at its coding regions, but also at exonâ€“intron boundaries and promoter regions. Most of PTEN mutations at exonâ€“intron boundaries or promoter regions have a major impact in the levels of expression of the PTEN protein, being causative of PTEN functional deficiency and considered as pathogenic (54â€“56). Mutations targeting the PTEN coding region include frame-shift and nonsense mutations, which also generate unstable truncated PTEN proteins in most of the cases (36), as well as missense mutations that result in individual amino acid changes. Functional analyses of a limited number of these missense mutations have revealed that, in many cases, the resultant amino acid substitutions generate PTEN proteins with impaired intrinsic catalytic activity and/or protein stability (36â€“39). Also, some examples have been described of missense PTEN mutations that do not affect the intrinsic catalysis nor the stability of the protein, but rather impair essential regulatory PTEN properties, such as binding to membranes or nuclear entry (40,57). Our previous study using the heterologous yeast system as a reporter of the activity of PTEN mutations in vivo revealed that such system reproduces with fidelity the effects on mammalian cells of mutations that diminish either the intrinsic PTEN catalytic activity and/or binding to membranes or the intrinsic PTEN protein stability (30). Our current comprehensive functional study of tumor-associated PTEN mutations indicates that almost all mutations targeting the P-catalytic loop confer loss of PTEN intrinsic catalytic activity (12 of 13), whereas mutations targeting the WPD- or the TI-loops are less frequently associated with full loss of catalysis (5 of 9 and 4 of 9, respectively). These results are in agreement with the Ala-scanning analysis of these regions and suggest the existence of a relatively large number of tumor-associated mutations at the PTEN gene that do not fully abrogate the PTEN catalytic activity, but may be relevant in clinics. Recently, a comprehensive study on PTEN mutations in PHTS disease has yielded predictive clinical parameters (58). Association of reported mutations to the activity of PTEN by means of ready in vivo functional assays, as the one exploited here, might help clinicians in decisions towards putative mutation-specific therapies.  PHTS and ASD/DD are syndromes with distinct clinical entities, which share macrocephaly as a frequent common alteration (59). Also, clinicians have noted that PHTS patients often display neurobehavioral features resembling autism (19) and, interestingly, at least five PTEN mutations (H93R, Y176C, F241S, D252G and R173H; see Supplementary Material, Table S1) have been reported as associated with both PHTS and ASD/DD (19,41,42,58). Our comparative analysis of germline mutations found in PHTS patients and in ASD/DD patients revealed a distinct functional pattern for these two groups of mutations. PHTS-associated mutations, which included in our study mutations distributed all along the PTEN protein, were found significantly more deleterious for PTEN catalysis than ASD/DD-associated mutations (Fig. 6). This could be important for the distinct etiology and progress of tumor-related and tumor non-related syndromes associated with PTEN mutations and may be of relevance in the design and implementation of new therapies for these diseases. It is likely that small variations in the lipid phosphatase activity or in the stability of heterozygotic PTEN mutations can explain the higher penetrance found for the set of PHTS-associated mutations, when compared with ASD/DD-associated mutations. Although it has been suggested that ASD- and macrocephaly-related PTEN mutations may behave differentially in terms of loss of function (19), the lack of functional models has made difficult to provide support for this hypothesis. If this is the case, as suggested by our study, additional unknown factors might exist affecting differentially the etiology and/or progression of these diseases. In this regard, a study focused on the functional analysis of the PHTS- and ASD-associated H93R PTEN mutation reported a partial loss of catalytic activity for this mutation, as well as a defect in the binding to PTEN-activating PIP2 model membranes. Remarkably, the binding of the H93R mutation to phosphatidylserine membranes, which are abundant in mammalian cells, was augmented (60). Our results show that the H93R mutation retained most of its lipid phosphatase activity in the yeast, suggesting that differences in the thresholds that control membrane-binding mediated PTEN activation may exist in distinct cell systems. Also of interest, mice with diminution of PTEN expression levels as subtle as 20% develop a wide spectrum of tumors with high penetrance, and it has been proposed that altered gene dosage may be relevant in ASD/DD (18,61). In this regard, ASD/DD has been linked with abnormal synapsis growth and plasticity, an alteration that has also been observed in mice with PTEN-deficient neurons (62,63). Furthermore, a mice model lacking PTEN expression in mature neuronal populations in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus displayed behavioral abnormalities reminiscent of human ASD/DD (64). Our findings show a relatively weak association between ASD/DD-related mutations at the PTEN gene and full loss of intrinsic lipid phosphatase activity or protein stability, which is in line with the lack of concordance between ASD/DD and childhood cancer (65). ASD/DD constitutes a heterogeneous, multigene-linked group of developmental disorders (41,42,66). Further studies will be required to ascertain the functional changes on the activity of the PTEN protein from ASD/DD patients with mutations at the PTEN gene. The comprehensive analysis of the functional properties of putative pathogenic mutant proteins, as the one we present here for PTEN mutations, will give some light on the molecular pathways altered in the neurons of patients with ASD/DD.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Cells, media, growth conditions, transfection and protein detection  The S. cerevisiae strain YPH499 (MATa ade2â€“101 trp1â€“63 leu2â€“1 ura3â€“52 his3-â–µ200 lys2â€“801) was used for heterologous expression of mammalian proteins. For all the analyses, synthetic complete medium was used, containing 0.17 % yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% ammonium sulfate supplemented with appropriate amino acids and nucleic acid bases, and added 2% glucose (SD), galactose (SG) or raffinose (SR), as required. Yeasts were transformed by standard procedures. Growth of yeast on plates was tested by spotting transformant cells onto SD or SG plates lacking the corresponding auxotrophic markers. Transformants were grown overnight in SD lacking uracile, leucine or both (SD-U, SD-L or SD-UL) as required and adjusted to an OD600 of 0.5. Five microliter aliquots of each sample plus three serial 1/10 dilutions were deposited on the surfaces of solid media SG-U, SG-L or SG-UL. Growth was monitored after 2â€“3 days at 30Â°C. Expression of all PTEN mutations in yeast was verified by immunoblot on yeast lysates with 421B or 425A anti-PTEN mAb (67) followed by horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Calbiochem). To measure GFP-Akt1 plasma membrane localization, as an indirect indicator of cellular PIP3 levels, transformant cells were grown to log phase in liquid SR medium lacking the corresponding auxotrophic markers, and then 2 % galactose was added for 6â€“8 h. GFP-Akt1 was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. To obtain statistically significant data, â‰¥100 cells were examined from each condition or experiment for either cytoplasmic or membrane-associated localization. Cells were examined under an Eclipse TE2000U microscope (Nikon) and digital images were acquired with Orca C4742-95-12ER charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu) and Aquacosmos Imaging Systems or HCImage software. To overexpress PTEN mutations in mammalian cells, COS-7 cells (simian kidney) were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method and processed after 48 h. To measure p-Akt content in COS-7 cells in the presence of PTEN mutations, cells were co-transfected with pRK5 PTEN and pSG5 HA-Akt1 as described (68). Cells were lysed, and post-nuclear lysates were subjected by immunoblot using a mixture of anti-p-Thr308 and anti-p-Ser473-Akt antibodies (Cell Signalling Technologies). Membranes were stripped and probed for anti-Akt antibody (Cell Signalling Technologies). Bands were quantified using ImageQuant TL software, and results are represented as the average Â± SD of the p-Akt/Akt ratio.  Plasmids, mutagenesis and in vitro phosphatase assays  YCpLG myc-p110-CAAX, pYES2 PTEN, pRK5 PTEN, pSG5 HA-Akt1 and pYES3 GFP-Akt1 have been described previously (30). Mutagenesis was performed by a two-step PCR strategy. All mutations were checked by DNA sequencing. The sequences of oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are available on request. In vitro phosphatase assays were made using PTEN wild-type or mutations, from COS-7-transfected cells, as the enzymes, and diC8-phosphatydilinositol PIP3 (Echelon) as the substrate, as described previously (30).&lt;/th&gt;\n",

       "                &lt;th&gt;Mutation screening of the breast and ovarian cancerâ€“predisposition genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 is becoming an increasingly important part of clinical practice. Classification of rare nontruncating sequence variants in these genes is problematic, because it is not known whether these subtle changes alter function sufficiently to predispose cells to cancer development. Using data from the Myriad Genetic Laboratories database of nearly 70,000 full-sequence tests, we assessed the clinical significance of 1,433 sequence variants of unknown significance (VUSs) in the BRCA genes. Three independent measures were employed in the assessment: co-occurrence in trans of a VUS with known deleterious mutations; detailed analysis, by logistic regression, of personal and family history of cancer in VUS-carrying probands; and, in a subset of probands, an analysis of cosegregation with disease in pedigrees. For each of these factors, a likelihood ratio was computed under the hypothesis that the VUSs were equivalent to an â€œaverageâ€� deleterious mutation, compared with neutral, with respect to risk. The likelihood ratios derived from each component were combined to provide an overall assessment for each VUS. A total of 133 VUSs had odds of at least 100:1 in favor of neutrality with respect to risk, whereas 43 had odds of at least 20:1 in favor of being deleterious. VUSs with evidence in favor of causality were those that were predicted to affect splicing, fell at positions that are highly conserved among BRCA orthologs, and were more likely to be located in specific domains of the proteins. In addition to their utility for improved genetics counseling of patients and their families, the global assessment reported here will be invaluable for validation of functional assays, structural models, and in silico analyses.Sequence-based testing for BRCA1 (MIM 113705) and BRCA2(MIM 600185) mutations is now widely available through both commercial laboratories and research studies. Whereas thousands of BRCA1 and BRCA2 truncating mutations have been associated with increased risk of cancer in carriers, the contribution of other BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequence variants to cancer risk remains largely undefined. These â€œvariants of unknown significanceâ€� (VUSs) are mainly missense mutations but also include a number of intronic variants and inframe deletions and insertions (IFDIs). The open-access online Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) Database, which functions as a repository of sequence alterations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, contains &amp;gt;1,500 distinct sequence variants that are currently reported as having unknown clinical significance. To date, classification of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 VUSs as cancer predisposing or neutral has proven problematic, because it is not known whether these subtle changes alter the function of the proteins sufficiently to predispose to cancer. Determination of their disease relevance on the basis of population or family studies has also proved difficult, because most of the alleles encoding these mutations are very rare and, in some cases, population specific. Although identified in a minority (5%â€“10%) of individuals tested clinically, the number of such tests performed annually worldwide means that a large number of women (and their families) are affected by the VUS issue. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that minority ethnic populations are disproportionately affected. VUSs in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes pose significant problems, because patients and physicians do not know whether the VUSs predispose to cancer or are neutral with respect to cancer risk. As a result, carriers of VUSs and their family members cannot take advantage of the risk assessment, prevention, and therapeutic measures that are available to carriers of known deleterious truncating mutations. 1 In addition, carriers of VUSs are sometimes counseled to undergo prophylactic oophorectomy or mastectomy because of the presence of the VUS, but in the absence of any knowledge of the cancer relevance of the VUS. For these reasons, the determination of the clinical relevance of VUSs in BRCA1 and BRCA2 has become an important clinical issue. Although the focus of this article is on BRCA1 and BRCA2, similar concerns and issues are found in virtually all complex, genetically heterogeneous diseases for which genetic testing is performedâ€”for example, colon cancer associated with mutations in mismatch repair genes. 2To address the problem of defining which VUSs are deleterious/disease causing and which are neutral, various types of evidence and classification schemes have been proposed.3; 4 ;  5 These include formal assessment of the cosegregation of the variant with disease in pedigrees,6; 7 ;  8 co-occurrence of the variant in question in trans with a known deleterious mutation, 9 and a number of in silico approaches that evaluate phylogenetic conservation and severity of the amino acid substitution. 10; 11 ;  12 In studies of other genes, evolutionary sequence-conservation analysis involving protein multiple-sequence alignments have been used to show that missense variants (MVs) at highly conserved/invariant residues are more often deleterious, whereas highly variable changes are more likely neutral. 13 ;  14 For BRCA1, Abkevich et al.10 developed a predictive algorithm that combines a measure of cross-species conservation, including nonmammalian BRCA1 sequences, with a measure of the degree of chemical change in amino acids, 15 to identify 50 putative deleterious BRCA1 missense mutations.A number of VUSs have been examined, in terms of their effect on protein, with use of functional assays. Efforts in this area have focused on BRCA1 mutations in the two C-terminal BRCT domains, 16 ;  17 which assess the transcriptional activation activity of the BRCT domains with use of mammalian and yeast-based models, 18; 19 ;  20 and on the E3 ligase activity associated with the N-terminal BARD1-binding domain of BRCA1.21 Examination of BRCA2 function has focused on assays of homology-directed repair and centrosome amplification in response to ectopic expression of full-length, wild-type VUS containing BRCA2 protein.22 Recently, crystal structures of the BRCA1 BRCT and BRCA2 DNA-binding domains have been used to predict that a number of VUSs predispose to cancer, 23; 24 ;  25 but genetic evidence suggests that some of these predictions are incorrect. Although none of the approaches described above have successfully been used to classify the clinical relevance of BRCA1 or BRCA2 VUSs, a number have shown promise in this regard. The development of methods based on functional assays, crystal structure, phylogenetic and sequence analyses, and other approaches has been hampered by the absence of a large number of VUSs that have been proven to be either deleterious or neutral on the basis of direct genetic evidence that can be used in validation of these various assays.In this article, we examine the genetic evidence for or against disease causality for a large number of variants, with use of a large database of tested individuals collected by Myriad Genetic Laboratories. In addition to analysis of co-occurrence of VUSs with established deleterious mutations and the analysis of VUS cosegregation in individual pedigrees, we apply a novel analysis of personal and family cancer history, using data on &amp;gt;70,000 individuals, to assess the clinical significance of 1,433 distinct sequence variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2.MethodsSource of Data and Variants AnalyzedThe data analyzed for this article come from the large database of full-sequence testing for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, performed at Myriad Genetic Laboratories. Since our primary focus was on the analysis of personal and family history, we began with all 70,071 individuals receiving full-sequence tests as of December 2005. To avoid potential confusion over which part of the personal/family history was due to which variant, this data set was reduced by eliminating all individuals who had more than one reported sequence variant (including both VUS and pathogenic mutations), which resulted in a set of 61,270 individuals with at most a single BRCA1 or BRCA2 sequence variant. We then divided the family history data set into several ethnic groups, since we postulated that probands of different ethnic backgrounds are expected to present with different distributions of mutations and different distributions of personal and family histories of cancer. After examining the data set with use of some preliminary logistic regressions to examine heterogeneity as a function of reported ethnicity, we constructed three separate groups that had similar family-history and mutation-prevalence profiles. These groups were: (a) western European, central/eastern European, other/none specified, Native American, and Asian; (b) Ashkenazi Jewish; and (c) Latin American/Caribbean and African American. In the first group, 72% were of European ancestry, 24% did not specify an ethnicity, and 4% were reported as of Asian, Middle Eastern, or Native American origin. Individual probands who reported mixed ancestry between these broad groups (e.g., Western European and Caribbean) were not included in the final data set, leaving 60,529 individual probands for analyses of family history. Table 1 shows the distribution by ethnicity and testing results of these individuals. A total of 1,433 distinct unclassified variants in 4,623 tested probands were identified through sequencing and are the subject of this article.Table 1.Results of Full BRCA Sequence Analysis of 60,529 Tested ProbandsNo. (%) of Subjects with GenotypeEthnic Group\tWild Type\tNeutral\tVUS\tBRCA1 Deletion\tBRCA2 DeletionEuropeana\t41,899 (78.6)\t1,993 (3.7)\t3,972 (7.5)\t3,102 (5.8)\t2,334 (4.4)Ashkenazi Jewish\t3,622 (80.6)\t381 (8.5)\t258 (5.7)\t139 (3.1)\t91 (2.0)African American/Caribbean\tâ€‚1,667 (60.9)\t398 (14.5)\t393 (14.3)\t176 (6.4)\t104 (3.8)â€ƒTotal\t47,188 (78.0)\t2,772 (4.6)\t4,623 (7.6)\t3,417 (5.6)\t2,529 (4.2)aSee the text for the description of ethnicity for this group.Table optionsAs before,3 we assumed that all variants can be classified as deleterious mutations (M) or neutral variants (V). Our aim was to calculate a likelihood ratio (LR) of the formView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onfor each variant, given the available data. These ratios (or Bayes factors) can be combined with prior probabilities to obtain an absolute probability that each variant is deleterious. In this work, we first focused on the data sources that are most straightforwardly quantifiable from pedigree data: co-occurrence with known deleterious mutations, family history, and cosegregation. These three sources of data are independent, and the LR can therefore be derived by multiplying the LRs from the three components. We then used an admixture model to examine the influence of the type of mutation.Co-Occurrence with Known Deleterious MutationsTo include information on the co-occurrence of a VUS in trans phase with a deleterious mutation as evidence against the variant being disease causing, we followed the likelihood-ratio calculation described in our previous work. 3 We assumed that, for BRCA1, compound heterozygotes for two deleterious mutations are vanishingly rare (occur in the testing population with a frequency of 1 in 10,000), given both biological and genetic evidence that homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for deleterious BRCA1 mutations are embryonically lethal, 26 ;  27 whereas, for BRCA2, we assumed that the probability is 1 in 1,000, the increased frequency reflecting the fact that viable compound heterozygotes have been reported as Fanconi anemia, type D1. 28 ;  29 For these analyses, we used an updated data set based on âˆ¼100,000 tests with observed frequencies of BRCA1 and BRCA2 deleterious mutations of 6.6% and 5.0%, respectively. The phase of the VUS with an observed deleterious mutation was determined through examination of haplotypes of common polymorphisms known in other examples of each variant or when the VUS and the deleterious mutation were in the same PCR fragment, as determined by direct examination of the sequence traces. In some cases, phase could not be determined, and we assumed that the first deleterious mutation was in cis phase and that subsequent different deleterious mutations were in trans phase. The LR for deleterious versus neutral is expressed asView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onwhere n is the total number of times the variant was observed, k is the number of those that were in trans with a known deleterious mutation, p1 is the overall frequency of pathogenic mutations in the data set, and p2 is the probability of being a compound heterozygote for two pathogenic mutations (e.g., p1=0.066 and p2=1/10,000).Of the 1,433 VUSs studied here, 476 were observed at least five times, and 248 had at least 10 occurrences. Of the 1,433 variants, 44 were observed to occur with at least one deleterious mutation.Classification by Personal and Family History of Tested ProbandsWe developed likelihood models on the basis of family history,3 which, given the availability of the large Myriad Genetic Laboratories data set, is an extremely powerful tool for classification of VUSs. The method is based on the difference in personal and family-history profiles between individuals found to carry a true deleterious mutation and those with a wild-type BRCA sequence. The rationale is that mutation prevalence is known to be strongly dependent on certain key factors (e.g., disease status of the proband, age at diagnosis, and number and age of relatives with breast cancer [BRCA] or ovarian cancer), so these characteristics should also predict the probability of a new disease-causing missense mutation, whereas that of a neutral mutation should be independent of family history.We suppose that we have a set of probands drawn from a population with a certain distribution of family history. Suppose first that family history is classified into n types. Let pj be the probability that an individual with a mutation has family history type j, whereas qj is the corresponding probability for neutral variants. For a VUS that is deleterious, the predicted distribution of family history should be the same as that for known pathogenic mutations. The LR for a VUS with family history in category j drawn from the same population is thereforeView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onwhere {FH} is the set of all family histories in the study population. In theory, the probabilities pj and qj could be calculated from the proportions of individuals with each category of family history who are found to carry a deleterious mutation. In practice, however, there are large numbers of possible constellations of family history, and the numbers of mutations in some categories would be very small. Instead, we estimated these probabilities by fitting a logistic-regression model. Thus, we fitted a model in which the outcome was the occurrence of a deleterious mutation versus a normal sequence, and summaries of personal and family history were included as covariates.This model then provides predicted probabilities rk that individual k is a mutation carrier, given his or her FH, isrk=P(M|{FH}k)â€‰â€Šâ€Š.Turn MathJax onLet r0 be the corresponding probability under the null hypothesis that the mutation is unrelated to family history or, equivalently, the prior probability of a deleterious mutation in the population. This is estimated by the overall proportion of individuals who have a deleterious mutation (rather than a normal sequence). For example, with use of the data in table 1, for the European group for BRCA1,View the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onThenView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onandView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onTherefore, the required LR isView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onthat is, the odds ratio (OR) of the predicted probability that the individual with the given family history is a mutation carrier against the corresponding probability under the null hypothesis. Where there are multiple individuals with the same VUS, the LRs can be multiplied. We note that this formulation implicitly assumes that all pathogenic mutations in the same gene confer identical risksâ€”that is, that there is no allelic heterogeneity.To implement this analysis, the logistic-regression model was fitted separately for each ethnic group and separately for BRCA1 and BRCA2. To construct a predictive model to be applied to the VUS probands, we used a logistic-regression model within each ethnic group, comparing the personal and family histories of individuals with known deleterious sequences versus those with normal sequences. The specific factors used in the prediction were categorized asPersonal history of tested individualBRCA1.â€‚None,2.â€‚Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) only, orDiagnosis of BRCA at age3.â€‚â©¾60,4.â€‚50â€“59,5.â€‚40â€“49,6.â€‚30â€“39, or7.â€‚&amp;lt;30.Ovarian cancer1.â€‚None orDiagnosis of ovarian cancer at age2.â€‚â©¾60,3.â€‚50â€“59,4.â€‚40â€“49, or5.â€‚&amp;lt;40.Male BRCA1.â€‚Yes or2.â€‚No.Bilateral BRCA1.â€‚Yes or2.â€‚No.andReported family history of tested proband (assessed as twice the number of first-degree relatives with given cancer type plus the number of second-degree relatives with given cancer type) (table 2).Table 2.

The predicted probabilities pk were obtained using the â€œpredictâ€� option in STATA.As a simple validation of the process outline above, we examined the family history ORs for the known deleterious variants. Of the 1,106 distinct deleterious variants examined, 123 had odds of &amp;gt;100:1 in favor of being deleterious, 216 had odds of &amp;gt;10:1, and no known variants were excluded at this same threshold. Although we recognize that these summaries may overstate the modelâ€™s out-of-sample predictive ability, since the deleterious variants were used to construct the logistic regressions, they do provide reassurance that, in general, the method is performing as we expected. Further confirmation of this is obtained by looking at the similar calculation for 44 variants already classified as neutral and not used in either the logistic regression or in the subsequent analysis of VUSs. Of these 44 variants, 33 had odds against being deleterious of &amp;gt;100:1, and the other 11 all had odds against being deleterious of a lesser magnitude.Cosegregation of VUSs in PedigreesElsewhere, we developed a general-pedigree likelihood method for evaluating cosegregation of variants with disease in families that can be used to assess disease causality for unclassified sequence variants.6 The pedigree likelihood is evaluated under the hypothesis that the variant under consideration has the same penetrance as the â€œaverageâ€� known deleterious mutation, compared with the hypothesis that the variant segregates independent of disease in the pedigree(s) under study.As part of an effort to assess the clinical significance of VUSs, individuals found, through the full-sequence testing by Myriad Genetic Laboratories, to carry a VUS are offered free testing of additional family members on a research basis. These additional individuals can be unaffected or affected with BRCA or ovarian cancer and can be male or female. Typically, only 10% of individual probands with VUS provide such samples, and, in most cases, only one or two samples per family are obtained. The pedigree information available in the Myriad Genetic Laboratories database is somewhat descriptive in nature, and, for this reason, we used a simplified model of BRCA1/2 penetrance, with seven liability classes corresponding to (1) unaffected and aged &amp;lt;20 years (or male), (2) unaffected and aged 21â€“49 years, (3) unaffected and aged â©¾50 years, (4) affected with BRCA at age &amp;lt;50 years, (5) affected with BRCA at age â©¾50, (6) affected with ovarian cancer at age &amp;lt;50, and (7) affected with ovarian cancer at age â©¾50. For each liability class, penetrance values were taken from the 2003 study of Antoniou et al., 30 by collapsing the incidence rates across the broader categories used in that study. These pedigrees were then analyzed using a modification of the LINKAGE package,31 as described by Thompson et al.,4 to obtain the required LR.Because the analysis of cosegregation relies on the distribution of the additional genotype data in the pedigree, conditional on the pedigree (including the proband) phenotypes, it is statistically independent from the family/personal information. Similarly, the co-occurrence data is independent from the other two sources, since individuals who also have known deleterious mutations are not considered in these analyses. Thus, the three individual LRs can be multiplied to arrive at a combined LR.Evaluation of Heterogeneity by Variant ClassTo estimate the proportion of mutations in the data set that are likely to be clinically significant as a function of location, conservation, class, etc., we performed a heterogeneity analysis analogous to that routinely used in linkage analysis. Specifically, the required likelihood is given byView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onThis likelihood (in practice, the log likelihood) is then maximized over Î±, and 95% CIs were constructed by finding those values of 2ln(likelihood) that differed by &amp;lt;3.84 from the maximum value. Hypotheses regarding differences in values of Î± as a function of partitions of the total variant space are performed using likelihood-ratio tests.The 1,433 variants were subdivided into the following groups:1.â€‚Variants that changed the resulting proteinâ€”for example, MVs and IFDIs;2.â€‚Variants that were extremely likely, on the basis of studies of many genes and experimental data, to affect splicing, defined for our purposes as (a) all IVSÂ±Â½ or (b) if the last nucleotide of the exon is G and if the first five bases of the subsequent intron are not GTRAG. Note that the latter set includes some missense mutations as well as silent substitutions; mutations that were missense changes as well as splice variants were counted only in the splice variant group.3.â€‚Other variants, consisting primarily of intronic variants not located within 2 bp of the intron/exon splice junction, exonic variants likely to affect splicing but not meeting the strict definition above, and also a small number of variants in the 5â€² UTRs and truncating variants at the extreme 3â€² end of the genes.For the missense/IFDI category, we further subdivided the variants by their location within one of two recognized functional domains of the proteins: the C-terminus region containing the BRCA1 BRCT repeats, defined loosely here as â€œamino acids 1396â€“1862,â€� and the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 2500â€“3098). We also categorized these variants according to whether the wild-type residue involved in the substitution/deletion was evolutionarily conserved through the pufferfish Tetraodon, using multiple-sequence alignments constructed by S.V.T. 10 and available on the Align GVGD Web site. In the case of three inframe insertions, these were denoted as â€œconservedâ€� if the alignment across species was stable in the region surrounding the location of the insertion.Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 9.0 (StataCorp). The heterogeneity analysis was performed using the R programming language.ResultsWe first built the logistic-regression model comparing probands found with wild-type BRCA sequence with those with known deleterious mutations, using the factors detailed in the â€œ Methodsâ€� section. As might be expected with the very large sample sizes used in the analysis, the logistic regressions were highly significant with good predictive power; areas under the ROC curve were âˆ¼0.80 for BRCA1 and âˆ¼0.70 for BRCA2. Not surprisingly, the most highly significant predictive factors associated with a deleterious BRCA1 mutation were associated with personal and family history of ovarian cancer, with high ORs for early-onset BRCA as well. For BRCA2, the most important factors were a personal history of male BRCA and personal/family history of early-onset BRCA. Interestingly a strong family history of BRCA diagnosed after age 50 years was associated with an increased probability of having a BRCA2 mutation but a decreased risk of carrying a BRCA1 deleterious mutation. For both genes, there were strong dose-response effects for decreasing age at onset of BRCA (or ovarian cancer) and also for increasing numbers of affected relatives. The details of the parameter estimates are provided in table 2 for the large European sample set; those for the other two ethnic classifications were broadly similar. The ethnicity- and gene-specific logistic-regression equations were then applied to a total of 3,951 family and personal histories of tested probands found to carry a VUS, to obtain log-ORs as described in the â€œMethodsâ€� section. The average number of such scores per variant was 2.76, with a range of 1â€“77; over half of the studied variants had only a single family history available for study. One hundred eighty-two distinct variants had 5 or more family-history scores; of these, 72 had at least 10 family-history scores. The associated log-odds of causality per variant ranged from âˆ’10.6 to 11.2, with a mean of âˆ’0.26. Sixteen variants had total family history log10-likelihoodâ€“ratio (LLR) scores &amp;gt;2, whereas 55 VUSs had scores &amp;lt;âˆ’2, indicating odds of 100:1 for and against the variant being deleterious, respectively, on the basis of the family-history analysis alone.In total, 351 pedigrees of probands with 127 (45 BRCA1; 82 BRCA2) distinct variants were analyzed for cosegregation with disease in families. Odds based on the pedigree data alone ranged from 138:1 in favor of causality based on six pedigrees to &amp;gt;250,000:1 against causality based on analysis of 17 pedigrees. It should be noted that the variants targeted for this analysis were selected on the basis of prior evidence that such analysis could contribute to the likelihood calculation. In the co-occurrence analysis, 121 variants were observed at least once in trans with a known deleterious mutation, and 21 were observed two or more times. The LLRs for this source of information ranged from &amp;lt;âˆ’8 (for the variant BRCA1*N723D seen 82 times, of which 4 were in trans with a deleterious mutation) to 1.1 (BRCA1*A1708E, seen 76 times, never with a deleterious mutation). The combined evidence from all three sources ranged from odds of &amp;gt;1011:1 in favor of disease causality to 1012:1 against causality.Figure 1 contains the frequency distribution by gene of the combined log-odds of causality for the 1,433 VUSs. From this figure, we see that, whereas 133 variants could be classified as neutral with odds of &amp;gt;100:1, only 24 variants (18 BRCA1; 6 BRCA2) achieved this level of classification in favor of causality. The vast majority of variants analyzed are relatively uninformative and do not individually provide information ( fig. 1). Figure 2 displays the distribution of the log-odds of causality for missense and IFDIs as a function of whether they are located in the BRCT domain of BRCA1 or the DNA-binding domain of BRCA2. Although 27 of the 30 variants with odds in favor of causality &amp;gt;10:1 are in one of these two domains, it should be noted that 29 variants within these domains have odds in favor of neutrality of &amp;gt;100:1.Frequency histogram of combined LLR for 1,433 sequence VUSs, by gene (BRCA1 or ...Figure 1.

For those variants with both family history and cosegregation information, there was a modest but significant correlation between the log-odds scores for these two sources (r=0.32;

These results are shown in table 5.Table 5.Heterogeneity Analysis of VUSs by Selected CharacteristicsNo. of VUSs with LLRVariant Class\tn\tÎ± (95% CI)\t&amp;gt;1.3\t&amp;lt;âˆ’2All:\t1,433\t.20 (.16â€“.25)\t43\t133â€ƒBRCA1\t510\t.22 (.16â€“.28)\t26\t70â€ƒBRCA2\t923\t.18 (.13â€“.25)\t17\t63MV/IFDI:\t1,177\t.12 (.08â€“.17)\t22\t117â€ƒDomain:\t\t\t\tâ€ƒâ€ƒIn BRCT/DBD\t323\t.35 (.26â€“.45)\t21\t29â€ƒâ€ƒOther MV/IFDI\t854\t.0 (.0â€“.04)\t1\t88â€ƒSequence Conservation:\t\t\t\tâ€ƒâ€ƒInvarianta\t218\t.46 (.34â€“.58)\t17\t14â€ƒâ€ƒVariable\t959\t.03 (.0â€“.07)\t5\t103Splice\t79\t1.0 (.91â€“1.0)\t14\t0Other\t177\t.26 (.15â€“.39)\t7\t16aIn our alignment of vertebrate BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequences, available at the Align GVGD Web site.Table optionsOverall, there was no significant difference between BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the estimated proportion of variants that were deleterious (likelihood-ratio test, Ï‡2 1 df=0.69; not significant). However, there was significant heterogeneity among the three classes of sequence variant (missense/IFDI, splice, and other) (Ï‡2 2 df=109.7; P&amp;lt;.0001); 100% of splice-site mutations were estimated to be deleterious, compared with 12% of missense/IFDI mutations and 26% of other unclassified sequence variants. As in the overall set, no significant differences in the fraction of MVs estimated to be deleterious were observed between BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants. A strong association with the position of the mutation was observed with 35% (95% CI 26%â€“45%) of mutations within BRCT or DBD domains estimated to be deleterious, compared with 0% of mutations outside these domains (Ï‡2 1 df=56.3; P&amp;lt;.0001). There was no significant difference in the estimated proportion of deleterious mutations in the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain (33%) and the BRCA1 BRCT domain (37%). When mutations were classified by conservation among species, 46% (95% CI 32%â€“60%) of the conserved variants were classified as deleterious, compared with 3% of the nonconserved substitutions (Ï‡2 1 df=59.7; P&amp;lt;.0001). However, here, we did observe marginally statistically significant evidence that a higher proportion of BRCA1 missense substitutions occurring at strongly conserved positions were deleterious compared with those of BRCA2 (64% vs. 35%; P=.013).DiscussionUsing an approach based on three conditionally independent sources of information contained in the Myriad Genetic Laboratories large BRCA testing data set, we evaluated 1,433 sequence variants of unknown clinical significance in the BRCA susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Through this analysis, we were able to classify 93 variants with a threshold of odds of 1,000:1, 157 at 100:1, and 222 with odds of at least 20:1. In each case, the majority (e.g., 133 of 157 for 100:1 threshold) of VUSs classified were found to be of no clinical significance with respect to cancer risk. Although additional BRCA testing data produced by Myriad Genetic Laboratories, as well as similar data potentially available from other testing laboratories, primarily in Europe, could classify additional variants with use of this approach, it is clear that the majority of variants are unlikely to be classified in this manner, which highlights the need for use of other data. However, it should be noted that, because the variants most likely to be classified using our approach are generally the ones with many observations, the number of families who could benefit from our results is relatively large. On the basis of the Myriad database alone and with the assumption of a threshold for causality of 1,000:1 and for neutrality of 100:1, as proposed in Goldgar et al., 3 1,569 probands and their families may now have a more informative test result. Although only 140 of these are associated with a variant classified as a deleterious mutation that can be used in genetics counseling of their families, there is some benefit for the rest in knowing that they are unlikely to carry a clinically significant mutation and that their risk is that conferred by their family history alone.We emphasize that all the methods used in this article are based on the assumption that these variants are either neutral with respect to cancer risks or that they have the same age- and site-specific risks as the average BRCA mutation as estimated by Antoniou et al. 30 If a particular variant were associated with lower penetrance (but still elevated over noncarrier rates), it might provide inconclusive evidence, even given a large amount of available data, and/or there would be conflicts between the different sources of evidence (as well as other such as functional or in silico studies).Although most of the information for classification in this study is derived from the family-history analysis, in several instances, the three sources were needed to achieve a clinically useful threshold. For example, the BRCA1 variant I1766S (see table 3) shows odds in favor of causality of 13:1 from analysis of five family histories, 7.4:1 from cosegregation analysis of a single pedigree, and 1.44:1 on the basis of its observation seven times, never with a deleterious mutation, yielding overall odds of 139:1 in favor of this variant being deleterious compared with neutral. In contrast, the intronic variant BRCA1*IVS19-12Gâ†’A shows convincing odds based on six family histories (&amp;gt;30,000:1), but this conflicts with the pedigree cosegregation data (odds of 115:1 against, on the basis of three pedigrees); the overall combined evidence for this variant is 363:1, similar to that for I1766S. The reasons for this anomaly are unclear. It might reflect an unusual structure of families from the population from which this variant derives, or it might reflect some unusual pattern of risks associated with the mutation that are not well handled by these methods. To resolve this discrepancy, it would be helpful to verify the pedigree data and cancer diagnoses from the original provider/genetics counselor. Additionally, although there are no data from sequence homology to help in this analysis, in vitro tests of splicing might also provide data on the pathogenicity of this variant. Of the different approaches, we regard the cosegregation analysis as the most robust, since it relates directly to the disease risk and requires few assumptions. Unfortunately, relatively few variants can be classified by this approach alone. Our results demonstrate that the family-history classification can be very powerful, but it is more susceptible to bias due to population-specific ascertainment, 8 although this bias may be minimized by appropriate stratification into subgroups with different mutation prevalences. This highlights the need for some caution in the use of these predictions, especially when there are discrepancies between the methods.Of the 1,433 variants examined, the overall estimate of the proportion of those that are deleterious was 20%, indicating that perhaps as many as 286 of these variants could be deleterious mutations. As expected, there was good evidence that variants predicted to disrupt consensus splice donors were, as a group, deleterious; in fact, the estimated proportion of deleterious mutations was 1.0, so that there was no evidence of neutral variants under the selection criteria we used. This group accounted for an estimated 30% of all deleterious variants examined in the series. Among variants that resulted in a predicted altered BRCA protein, it was estimated that 12% were deleterious, and our analyses indicated that most (if not all) deleterious variants in this group fall at strongly conserved residues and/or in the recognized domains encompassing the BRCT repeats in BRCA1 and the DNA-binding domain in BRCA2. Note that mutations in the ring-finger domain of BRCA1 have been classified elsewhere as deleterious and thus are not included in this analysis. As a group, almost half of all missense substitutions (and IFDIs) falling at positions that were invariant in our alignments of vertebrate BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequences were estimated to be deleterious; these variants, representing 218 of the 1,433 variants studied, would require odds of causality of 117:1 to have a posterior probability of 0.99 of being deleterious. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that VUSs in nonconserved residues or variants in other parts of the proteins are deleterious, the upper confidence limits for these groups indicate that it is unlikely that there are very many of these, and substantial evidence would be required to achieve a posterior probability of 0.99 for these variants. Although there was some slight evidence that the group of missense substitutions falling at variable residues includes deleterious substitutions, these were typically cases where the cross-species sequence variation was conservative and the substitution falls well outside the evolutionarily tolerated range of variation. Further, if only the 129 variants falling at invariant positions within the two important domains are considered, the proportion of variants that are estimated to be deleterious rises to 0.73 (0.58â€“0.86). Among the 177 variants that were located in introns but not at consensus splice sites, in potential exonic splice sites, in the 5â€² UTR, or at the extreme 3â€² ends of the coding sequence, there was some evidence that this group may harbor deleterious variants (estimated proportion 26%), with 9 variants having odds in favor of causality of &amp;gt;10:1.For the variants in this analysis, the estimated proportions in table 5 could be used as prior probabilities to estimate posterior probabilities that each variant is deleterious. On the assumption that a posterior probability of 90% would be required to classify a mutation as â€œprobably deleterious,â€� missense substitutions (prior probability 0.12) require odds of 66:1 in favor of causality to be classified. Ten variants in BRCA1 and five in BRCA2 could be classified on this basis. The data on species conservation provide a more precise classification, however. On the basis of that data, mutations at invariant residues would require only odds of âˆ¼10:1 to be classified as deleteriousâ€”12 variants in BRCA1 and 11 in BRCA2 reach this level. In contrast, mutations at variable residues would require odds of âˆ¼300:1, none of which do so.Although relatively few variants can currently be classified, these data can be combined with data from other sources to provide more-powerful discrimination. These data could include further pedigree cosegregation data, but also data on tumor histopathology, which is highly predictive of BRCA1 mutation status, 32 and data on loss of heterozygosity at the BRCA1 and BRCA2 loci. 33 ;  34 This approach has recently been used for classification of a small number of BRCA1/2 variants. 35; 36 ;  37The association with sequence conservation and mutation position that we have observed will also be useful for classification of new variants not present in this data set. Thus, these data indicate that a novel mutation identified in a high-risk family will have a substantial probability of being deleterious only if it occurs in a conserved domain. Note, however, that the â€œpriorâ€� probabilities given in table 5 refer strictly to the families and variants ascertained in this database, and their application outside this context should be undertaken with a degree of caution.Although many investigators have developed in silico approaches for classification and have used evaluation of sequence changes and some have applied functional data, all of these methods require external validation, and all have suffered from a lack of such validation. The data we generated here could serve as a useful source of validation of such approaches, through repeated sampling of each variant as neutral or deleterious on the basis of its posterior probability of causality and then use of the data to estimate parameters of sensitivity and specificity of other assays.What is the immediate clinical utility of the results from the present analyses? Clearly, variants with odds against causality of &amp;gt;1,000:1 (or even 100:1) could be considered neutral, rare polymorphisms for the purpose of genetics counseling, and the at-risk unaffected family members who carry such variants would be reassured that they are not at high risk of BRCA or ovarian cancer due to BRCA1 or BRCA2, although they could still be at increased risk on the basis of their family history alone. Those who carry 1 of the 10 variants for which the evidence achieves the threshold of 1,000:1, or perhaps the 48 (36 of which are at splice sites) with posterior probabilities &amp;gt;0.99, should logically be offered the same options as carriers of BRCA-truncating mutations. Apart from those variants that meet these thresholds, will it be useful to report intermediate categories of risk, such as â€œlikely deleteriousâ€� or â€œprobably neutral,â€� or should the current odds in favor of or against causality be reported to the provider? These questions will require consideration by specialists in risk communication and other disciplines and, as such, are beyond the scope of this study. Our goal in this effort is to eventually classify, with such information, a large number of variants as either â€œdeleteriousâ€� or â€œneutralâ€� and to incorporate the evidence behind the classification as part of the BIC database, as a centralized resource for clinicians and researchers alike. We feel that, with a systematic approach such as this, the problems of clinical interpretation and patient recommendations caused by these heretofore â€œuncertainâ€� variants can be minimized.&lt;/th&gt;\n",

       "                &lt;th&gt;Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for the majority of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, and therefore sequence analysis of both genes is routinely conducted in patients with early-onset breast cancer. Besides mutations that clearly abolish protein function or are known to increase cancer risk, a large number of sequence variants of uncertain signifi cance (VUS) have been identifi ed. Although several functional assays for BRCA1 VUSs have been described, thus far it has not been possible to conduct a high-throughput analysis in the context of the full-length protein. We have developed a relatively fast and easy cDNA-based functional assay to classify BRCA1 VUSs based on their ability to functionally complement BRCA1-defi cient mouse embryonic stem cells. Using this assay, we have analyzed 74 unclassifi ed BRCA1 missense mutants for which all predicted pathogenic variants are confi ned to the BRCA1 RING and BRCT domains.  SIGNIFICANCE: BRCA1 VUSs are frequently found in patients with hereditary breast or ovarian cancer and present a serious problem for clinical geneticists.

INTRODUCTION  Germline loss-of-function mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are known to result in an approximately tenfold increased lifetime risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Thus far, no other genes have been identifi ed with such a strong link to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC), and in the past decades, many women have been screened for germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 . This has resulted in the identifi cation of numerous pathogenic mutations as well as a large number of sequence variants for which the clinical relevance is not clear. In the most recent publication of the ENIGMA (Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles) group, an international consortium for the evaluation of BRCA1 or BRCA2 sequence variants, a total of 1,273 unique BRCA1 variants is mentioned ( 1 ), but this number may increase even further because of the implementation of high-throughput sequencing methods. Of the BRCA1 variants of uncertain signifi cance (VUS), 920 are nontruncating exonic mutations that may affect protein function or mRNA splicing, but for which there is not enough linkage information to indicate whether they are pathogenic. To aid genetic counseling of individuals with BRCA1/2 VUS, both genetic and functional classifi cation methods have been developed. Genetic analysis of BRCA1 or BRCA2 VUSs relies on cosegregation with disease, cooccurrence with known pathogenic mutations, and family history of cancer. These data have been integrated into computational models to calculate the likelihood that a VUS is disease-causing ( 2 ). Additional in silico analysis of the evolutionary conservation of the amino acids affected by the mutation and the predicted impact of the mutant amino acids on protein folding are also implemented in such models. Functional assays do not rely on preexisting data, but directly test the effect of BRCA1/2 VUSs on known functions of the encoded proteins ( 3 ). Although this may seem relatively straightforward, it can be diffi cult to extrapolate data from functional assays into cancer risks for patients. For instance, in most assays only part of the BRCA1 protein is analyzed. In addition, some of the more elegant assays are technically demanding and not suitable to analyze large numbers of mutations. We reasoned that a good functional assay should fulfi ll three basic requirements: (i) it should investigate the biologic effects of a BRCA1 VUS in the context of the full-length protein; (ii) it should be conducted under normal physiologic conditions in a noncancerous cell type; and (iii) it should be based on a highly standardized and reproducible protocol.  These considerations led us to develop a functional assay based on physiologic expression of full-length human BRCA1 cDNA in mouse embryonic stem cells that are genetically engineered to allow conditional deletion of endogenous Brca1 . Mutant BRCA1 cDNAs are generated using site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) and introduced in a defi ned genomic locus of mouse embryonic stem cells by recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). In this way, we have analyzed 86 BRCA1 variants for their effects on cell proliferation and drug sensitivity, including 74 clinically relevant VUSs.  RESULTS  Generation of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells Expressing BRCA1 Sequence Variants  Although BRCA1-defi cient tumor cells proliferate rapidly in situ , loss of BRCA1 in normal cells leads to a severe proliferation defect ( 4 ).

Brca1 -selectable conditional knockout (SCo) mouse embryonic stem cells ( 5 ). These cells carry one Brca1 -null allele and a selectable conditional Brca1SCo allele, which contains, in addition to loxP sites around exons 5â€“6, a split puromycin resistance marker that is activated upon Cre-mediated deletion of exons 5â€“6. They also contain a CreERT2 allele in the Rosa26 locus, which allows for controlled activation of Cre via administration of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4-OHT). Thus, BRCA1-defi cient embryonic stem cells can be easily obtained via 4-OHTâ€“induced inactivation of the Brca1SCo allele and subsequent selection for puromycin resistance ( Fig.  1 ; ref.  5 ). To allow effi cient integration of human BRCA1 variants in one specifi c genomic locus, we supplied the other Rosa26 allele with F3 and Frt recombination sites for RMCE by the site-specifi c recombinase Flp ( Fig.  1 and Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 6 ). Cells that have undergone successful RMCE can be selected because they express a truncated neomycin selection marker under control of the endogenous Rosa26 promoter, which further increases targeting effi ciency. Flpmediated recombination ensures single-copy integration of BRCA1 expression constructs at the same Rosa26 locus, thus avoiding position-effect variegation and copy numberâ€“ dependent differences in expression.  RMCE vectors were equipped with a human BRCA1 cDNA expression construct, which was modifi ed using SDM to introduce defi ned mutations in BRCA1 . The focus of our analysis was on Dutch and Belgian VUSs that were found in families with HBOC. We also included a number of variants  Figure 1. â€‚ Schematic overview of the RMCE procedure in R26 CreERT2/RMCE ; Brca1 SCo/Î” embryonic stem cells. Before the introduction of a human BRCA1 cDNA, R26 CreERT2/RMCE ; Brca1 SCo/Î” embryonic stem cells are mouse BRCA1-profi cient and sensitive to both neomycin and puromycin. Targeting of singlecopy human BRCA1 cDNA variants to the Rosa26 locus by Flp RMCE results in expression of human BRCA1 and neomycin resistance. Addition of 4-OHT leads to CreERT2-mediated deletion of mouse Brca1 exons 5 and 6, resulting in loss of mouse BRCA1 protein and concomitant expression of puromycin from the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter.

To allow validation of our functional complementation assay, we included a series of eight BRCA1 variants that are known to be deleterious or neutral according to the Breast Cancer Information Core database (BIC; http://research.nhgri .nih.gov/bic/ ; Supplementary Table S1). These controls include the well-known pathogenic BRCA1 founder mutations 185delAG and 5382insC and the neutral polymorphisms Y105C, R866C, and E1250K. The BIC designation is supported by the classifi cation according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( http://iarc.fr/ ), which includes the Align-GVGD score that indicates biophysical and evolutionary alterations ( http://agvgd.iarc.fr/ ; Supplementary Table S1; refs. 11, 12 ). Align-GVGD scores vary between C0 (likely neutral) and C65 (likely deleterious). Sequence-verifi ed constructs that contained the intended VUS, but no other BRCA1 mutations, were transfected into R26 CreERT2/RMCE;Brca1 SCo/Î” embryonic stem cells to undergo RMCE ( Fig.  2 ). Neomycin-resistant clones were pooled and RMCE was confi rmed by PCR analysis. Subsequently, protein expression of the human BRCA1 variants was analyzed by Western blot analysis with a human BRCA1-specifi c antibody ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2). Comparison with BRCA1 protein levels in embryonic stem cells expressing human BRCA1 from a bacterial artifi cial chromosome (BAC), which is known to rescue embryonic lethality of Brca1 -null mice ( 7 ,  13 ), showed that transcription of the human BRCA1 cDNA from the EF1A gene promoter results in physiologic levels of BRCA1 protein (Supplementary Fig.  S1). Most BRCA1 variants were expressed at equal levels, allowing comparison of their functional activities. A number of C-terminal BRCA1 mutants showed low levels of expression (Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary Fig. S2). Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that decreased protein expression was not caused by decreased mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig.  S3), suggesting that the low abundance of BRCA1 protein results from posttranslational events. In fact, for most of these variants, mutation-associated protein instability has already been documented in previous publications (refs. 8 , 14 , 15 ; Supplementary Table S2).  Functional Complementation Assay of BRCA1 Sequence Variants in Mouse Brca1 -Null Embryonic Stem Cells  As a fi rst functional test, we assayed the ability of BRCA1 variants to restore the proliferation defect of switched R26 CreERT2/RMCE ;Brca1 SCo/Î” embryonic stem cells ( Fig.  2 ). Expression of endogenous mouse Brca1 was shut off through overnight induction of Cre activity by 4-OHT, and 7 days  Figure 2. â€‚ Workfl ow for the functional classifi cation of BRCA1 sequence variants in Brca1 -null embryonic stem (ES) cells.

For each group of mutants tested, we included positive and negative controls consisting of embryonic stem cells containing, respectively, wild-type human BRCA1 cDNA and an empty RMCE vector. BRCA1 variants were evaluated on their ability to support growth compared with these controls (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Although we tested 28 mutations in the central domain encoded by exon 11 (aa 224â€“1366), BRCA1 variants that were unable to rescue the proliferation defect of Brca1 -null mouse embryonic stem cells to BRCA1 wild-type levels were confi ned to the conserved N- and C-terminal domains of BRCA1.  Cisplatin Sensitivity Assay for Classifi cation of BRCA1 Variants  Although the ability of BRCA1 variants to support proliferation appears to be indicative of VUS function, results were not always clear-cut (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). BRCA1 is known to be important for DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair through mechanisms that are both dependent ( 5 ) and independent ( 16 ) of its function in homologous recombination (HR). The role of BRCA1 in ICL repair is stressed by the occurrence of genetic reversion mutations restoring BRCA1 protein expression in platinum-resistant ovarian tumors in BRCA1 -mutation carriers ( 17, 18 ). We therefore decided to conduct a 96-wellâ€“based cisplatin sensitivity assay to allow a more stringent evaluation of BRCA1 VUS functionality.  Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) of cisplatin were determined using a resazurin cell viability assay, and BRCA1 variants were again classifi ed in comparison to wildtype BRCA1 and an empty RMCE vector. To obtain corrected cisplatin IC 50 values, we fi tted a log-logistic curve constrained at 1 and 0. We excluded a fi t if the residual squared error (RSE) exceeded 0.1. We then applied a Bayesian predictor to classify BRCA1 VUS as pathogenic or benign. Most variants that showed less than wild-type activity in the proliferation assay also scored as functionally impaired in the cisplatin sensitivity assay and were classifi ed as deleterious ( Table 1 ,  Table 1. â€‚ Functional classifi cation of BRCA1 VUS based on cisplatin response Variant DNA change Type of mutation a Classifi cation S4F c.11C&amp;gt;T VUS Not Clear M18T c.53T&amp;gt;C VUS Deleterious 185delAG c.68_69delAG Deleterious control Deleterious b K45Q c.133A&amp;gt;C VUS Neutral C61G c.181T&amp;gt;G Deleterious control Deleterious C64G c.190T&amp;gt;G VUS Deleterious b D67Y c.199G&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral Y105C c.314A&amp;gt;G Neutral control Neutral N132K c.396C&amp;gt;A VUS Neutral P142H c.425C&amp;gt;A VUS Neutral L147F c.441G&amp;gt;C VUS Neutral L165P c.494T&amp;gt;C VUS Neutral R170W c.508C&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral S186Y c.557C&amp;gt;A VUS Neutral V191I c.571G&amp;gt;A VUS Neutral T231M c.692C&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral D245V c.734A&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral L246V c.736T&amp;gt;G VUS Neutral V271L c.811G&amp;gt;C VUS Neutral S308A c.922A&amp;gt;G; c.923G&amp;gt;C Artifi cial h Not Clear L358R; C360R; E362H c.1073T&amp;gt;G; c.1078T&amp;gt;C; c.1084G&amp;gt;C; c.1086G&amp;gt;T Artifi cial Neutral L668F c.2002C&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral D695N c.2083G&amp;gt;A VUS Neutral P798L c.2393C&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral N810Y c.2428A&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral T826K c.2477C&amp;gt;A VUS Neutral (continued) Downloaded from cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org on May 26, 2017.

Variants showing increased cisplatin sensitivity were tested at least twice before they were classifi ed. The positive and negative controls classifi ed as expected, although the known pathogenic truncation mutation 5382insC scored as neutral in one of three assays, stressing the need for repeat experiments. Also BRCA1 variants that were previously tested in other assays conducted as expected. It should be noted that the artifi cial variants S308A and S1497A rescued proliferation and cisplatin responses of mouse Brca1 - defi cient embryonic stem cells in BAC complementation assays, but are predicted to be deleterious based on their effects on embryonic stem cell differentiation and their response to Î³-irradiation, respectively ( 7 ). The V1804D mutation scored as a neutral variant in our assay, which is in line with most published data ( 8, 9 ), except for the results of an embryonic stem cellâ€“based BAC complementation assay ( 7 ). Again, all BRCA1 mutations that were classifi ed as deleterious were confi ned to regions encoding the conserved N- and C-terminal domains ( Fig.  4 ), despite the observation that deletion of the central region encoded by exon 11 leads to genetic instability in mice ( 12 ). Remarkably, the three mutations that diminish the interaction between BRCA1 and PALB2 ( 10 ), just C-terminal of the region encoded by exon 11, had no effect on cisplatin sensitivity in this assay. Of note, there was in general good correlation between our classifi cation and the Align-GVGD score (Supplementary Table S4). Notable exceptions were the neutral control variant R866C, which validated our assay but scored as likely deleterious (C65) using Align-GVGD, and G1770V, which scored as likely neutral (C0) by Align-GVGD but was classi- fi ed as deleterious in our assay. Our assay also classifi ed some variants for which the Align-GVGD scores were less clear, emphasizing the usefulness of functional assays to complement in silico analysis.  We also analyzed the possible effects of all BRCA1 variants on mRNA splicing, which may have deleterious consequences but cannot be assessed in our cDNA-based assay. The predictive value for exonic variants outside the consensus splice sites is questionable ( 19, 20 ), but four missense mutations were present in existing splice sites (Supplementary Table S4). Although c.5154G&amp;gt;T (encoding W1718C) was deleterious, three of these variants were classifi ed as neutral in our assay. One of them, c.441G&amp;gt;C (encoding L147F), had an increased probability to damage the splice donor site of exon 7. Another variant, c.5072C&amp;gt;T (encoding T1691I), might also affect splicing, but no defect was measured in blood samples of mutation carriers ( 19 ). The third exonic splice site mutation that was classifi ed as neutral in our cisplatin sensitivity assay, c.133A&amp;gt;C (K45Q), is not predicted to lead to aberrant splicing.  Results from Proliferation and Cisplatin Sensitivity Assays Correlate with HR Activity of BRCA1 Variants  BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in DNA repair via HR ( 12 , 21 ). Together with non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), HR forms the cellular defense against DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), a severe type of DNA damage that is lethal if unrepaired. Although HR is essentially error-free, NHEJ is error-prone, and therefore defects in HR are known to lead to genomic instability.

Therefore, we used the direct repeat (DR)-GFP assay ( 27 ) to measure the effects on HR for a subset of our BRCA1 VUSs. A number of predicted pathogenic variants and controls were shuttled into R26 CreERT2/RMCE;Brca1 SCo/Î” ;Pim1 DR-GFP/wt embryonic stem cells carrying the DR-GFP reporter in the Pim1 locus. Expression of endogenous mouse Brca1 was switched off, and cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the I-SceI meganuclease as well as an mCherry fl uorescent marker to control for transfection effi ciency. Repair of I-SceIâ€“induced DNA DSBs in DR-GFP via HR leads to expression of GFP, which can be monitored by fl ow cytometry. All but one of the predicted pathogenic variants tested resulted in defective HR, thereby confi rming our functional classifi cation ( Fig. 5 ). The only predicted deleterious variant that did not signifi cantly differ from wild-type BRCA1 , R1699Q, seemed to support intermediate levels of HR activity.

It is known that BRCA1- and BRCA2- defi cient cells are extremely sensitive to PARP1 inhibition ( 28, 29 ), leading to a larger dynamic range between BRCA2- defi cient cells and isogenic BRCA2-profi cient controls than for cisplatin ( 30 ). We therefore tested complementation of PARP inhibitor sensitivity for a number of BRCA1 mutants and the BRCA1 wild-type control. Given the unexpected neutral effects of the M1400V, L1407P, and M1411T mutations in the PALB2 interaction domain, we decided to include these variants in this series, as well as the R1699Q and V1736A variants that have recently been shown to confer (intermediate) breast and ovarian cancer risk ( 31, 32 ). To allow direct comparison of results from different assays, we repeated the cisplatin sensitivity and proliferation assays in parallel to the olaparib sensitivity assay. Our results indicate that BRCA1 wild-type and empty vector controls indeed show a larger difference in sensitivity for olaparib than for cisplatin ( Fig.  6 ). However, this increase in dynamic range is accompanied by an increased variation between repeat experiments for BRCA1-profi cient samples. Nevertheless, the functional defect of the R1699Q and V1736A mutations becomes more evident, and there also Downloaded from cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org on May 26, 2017.

In the concurrent proliferation analysis, R1699Q and V1736A both show an intermediate functional defect (Supplementary Fig.  S4). Also the M1411T mutation seems to affect the response to PARP inhibition, but the difference with BRCA1 wild-type is not signifi cant. Interestingly, the L1407P and M1411T variants have previously been shown to be more defective than M1400V in a gene conversion assay ( 10 ). It should also be noted that, in contrast with the large-scale classifi cation experiments, the cisplatin sensitivity assay conducted in parallel to the PARP inhibitor assay identifi ed signifi cant functional defects for L1407P and V1736A.  DISCUSSION  Over the past few years several functional assays for classifi cation of BRCA1 VUSs have been developed. Several of these assays are restricted to functions of the BRCA1 protein that reside in the evolutionarily conserved RING or BRCT domains. Examples include in vitro transactivation assays for BRCT peptides ( 8 ) and measurement of ubiquitin ligase activity for protein fragments encompassing the N-terminal RING domain ( 33 ). Other assays were designed to evaluate the functions of full-length mutant BRCA1 protein, either by monitoring general effects on proliferation or response to DNA damage ( 7 ), or by directly focusing on the role of BRCA1 in DNA repair via HR ( 34 ).  Because BRCA1 VUSs are not restricted to regions encoding the N- or C-terminal domains, and given the observation that interaction between these domains is required for recruitment of BRCA1 to damaged DNA ( 35 ), functional assays for the full-length protein would be ideal. In principle, such assays can be conducted in cell lines derived from BRCA1 - mutated tumors, but there are indications that the outcome of assays for BRCA1 function depends on the cellular context. As absence of BRCA1 leads to loss of cellular viability, it is thought that additional mutations are required for BRCA1- associated tumorigenesis. For example, loss of p53 alleviates the consequences of BRCA1 defi ciency both in vitro and in vivo ( 4 ) and is common in BRCA1-defi cient tumors ( 36, 37 ). Also, depletion of 53BP1 is known to suppress the defects caused by BRCA1 defi ciency ( 5 , 38 , 39 ). Therefore, aberrations in BRCA1-defi cient tumor cells may mask functional defects of BRCA1 VUSs. We reasoned that assays in normal cells that can be depleted from endogenous BRCA1 expression are most likely to reveal functional defects of BRCA1 VUSs. The usefulness of this approach has been previously shown by Downloaded from cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org on May 26, 2017. Â© 2013 American Association for Cancer Research.

BAC complementation assays in mouse embryonic stem cells ( 7 , 40 ). However, mutagenesis of large BAC clones by recombineering and functional complementation of cells with these mutant constructs is time-consuming and technically demanding, and therefore cannot be conducted in a high-throughput setting. We therefore set out to develop a cDNA-based functional complementation assay in mouse embryonic stem cells that is easier to control and scale up and more suitable for routine functional classifi cation of BRCA1 sequence variants.  One advantage of BAC transgenics in complementation assays is that genes are expressed at physiologically relevant levels. This is the result of low copy-number integrations and the presence of natural regulatory elements required for proper gene expression. We decided to use RMCE to allow single-copy integration of BRCA1 cDNAs at one specifi c genomic locus. The use of RMCE effectively prevents multiple or partial integrations, concatemers, and position-effect variegation. As a result, all variants are expressed at equal levels. Moreover, transcription of BRCA1 cDNAs from the EF1A gene promoter results in physiologic levels of BRCA1 protein, comparable with those observed in embryonic stem cells stably transfected with a BAC containing the human BRCA1 locus. Indeed, the wild-type human BRCA1 cDNA was able to complement Brca1 -null embryonic stem cells in cellular proliferation, drug sensitivity, and HR assays. Our RMCE strategy uses BRCA1 cDNA constructs in which mutations can be swiftly introduced using SDM, enabling a higher throughput than introduction of mutations via BAC recombineering. In addition, the introduction of BRCA1 cDNAs via RMCE obviates the need to analyze multiple embryonic stem cell clones for correct integration and expression.  As a proof of principle, we used our functional complementation assay to analyze exonic BRCA1 VUSs that were identifi ed in families with HBOC in the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as a set of previously analyzed BRCA1 variants. A number of mutations resulted in reduced BRCA1 protein levels, most likely because of structural destabilization. In all cases, this led to diminished capacity for functional complementation. Also, several variants that gave rise to normal BRCA1 protein levels were unable to rescue the proliferation defect and cisplatin sensitivity of Brca1 -null embryonic stem cells. As BRCA1 loss of function mutations are associated with increased cancer risk, variants that score as functionally impaired in our embryonic stem cell assay system may be causally involved in tumor formation. This notion is supported by the fact that seven of eight known pathogenic or neutral control variants in our validation series were correctly classifi ed by the cisplatin sensitivity assay. The pathogenic 5382insC truncation mutation could not be classifi ed because it scored as neutral in one of three transfection series. This was probably due to technical reasons, as the 5382insC mutation did not restore HR activity in Brca1 -defi cient embryonic stem cells, in contrast with R1699Q, which was recently shown to confer intermediate risk of HBOC ( 32 ).  Our assay system yielded ambivalent results for nine other variants: S4F, S308A, S1651P, S1651F, T1691I, V1736A, E1735K, H1746Q, and R1753T. T1691I and E1735K were classifi ed as functionally impaired in only one cisplatin sensitivity test, whereas values from repeat experiments could not be taken into account because of RSE values above 0.1. S4F, S1651P, S1651F, V1736A, H1746Q, and R1753T were differently classifi ed in repeat experiments, which may refl ect technical fl aws or intermediate activity of these variants. Of note, the V1736A mutation was recently identifi ed as a pathogenic variant with hypomorphic activity in DNA repair ( 31 ). Although we did not measure signifi cant HR activity of V1736A in a DR-GFP gene conversion assay, intermediate activity of this variant is supported by the results of the proliferation assays and additional cisplatin sensitivity assays. S1651F showed HR activity similar to wild-type BRCA1 , whereas R1753T was HR-defi cient. S308A is an artifi cial mutation of a BRCA1 phosphorylation site that was able to support proliferation and resistance to DNA damage in an embryonic stem cell-based BAC complementation assay. However, S308A-complemented embryonic stem cells did show increased apoptosis when cultured in embryoid bodies ( 7 ), indicating a partial defect that might explain the ambivalent results for this mutation in our assays.  Our results show that BRCA1 variants should ideally be assayed in triplicate to avoid misclassifi cation. This also applies to BRCA1 VUS that we classifi ed as neutral, most of which were tested only once because in our current study we focused on variants that showed functional impairment. The striking restriction of unambiguously predicted pathogenic mutants to the terminal RING and BRCT domains suggests that some plasticity is allowed for the central domain of BRCA1. However, our dataset is still limited and more experiments are required to gain insight into the function of this domain.  Our cDNA-based system allows for several additional functional assays that have been described previously for BAC transgenic embryonic stem cells ( 7 ). These include assays for defects during in vitro and in vivo embryonic stem cell differentiation but also treatments with other cytotoxic agents. As a proof of principle, we investigated the activity of a number of mutants in the response to the PARP inhibitor olaparib. These included M1400V, L1407, and M1411T, which were previously shown to impair PALB2 binding and have a negative effect on BRCA1 function ( 10 ). Although the differences in sensitivity of BRCA1-defi cient versus BRCA1-profi cient embryonic stem cells are larger for olaparib than for cisplatin, increased variation between repeat experiments allowed us to identify functional defects only for L1407 and not for the other two variants in the PALB2 interaction domain, M1400V and M1411T. However, the R1699Q and V1736A variants, which are known to have hypomorphic activity, clearly showed a defect in the response to olaparib. Interestingly, both mutations are in the BRCT domain, and it has recently been shown that mutation of this domain especially confers sensitivity to PARP inhibition ( 41 ). Together, our results show that PARP inhibitor sensitivity assays may have added value, especially for the classifi cation of BRCA1 VUSs with intermediate phenotypes.  Platinum drugs and PARP inhibitors are selectively toxic to BRCA1-defi cient cells because they target HR defi ciency. Although the role of BRCA1 in HR is thought to be essential for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing accumulation of (oncogenic) mutations, other activities may also contribute to its tumor suppression function.

It will be interesting to see if this holds true for all BRCA1 variants or whether there are also pathogenic mutations that have no effect on HR.  As with any other in vitro approach, our functional complementation assay system might still fail to identify all pathogenic variants because it does not necessarily recapitulate all aspects of BRCA1 function in vivo . A limitation of our cDNA-based assay is also that it cannot be used to investigate effects on mRNA splicing. Although algorithms have been designed to predict possible splice defects, the consequences of mutations outside of the consensus splice sites especially require functional validation experiments. For this purpose, BAC complementation assays ( 7 ), minigene-based splicing assays, or BRCA1 transcript analysis of patient blood samples ( 19 ) may be instrumental. However, transacting factors also affect splicing, and these may be tissue specifi c ( 42 ). A possible solution would be to determine the presence of BRCA1 splice variants in tumor tissue from BRCA1 VUS carriers and use this information to generate a cDNA construct for analysis of the functional consequences. To evaluate BRCA1 VUSs, there remains a need for multifactorial models that combine results from functional assays and in silico analyses with genetic evidence and other information from mutation carriers. This also includes DNA copy number data from tumors from BRCA1 VUS carriers, as it is known that BRCA1- associated breast tumors show distinct genomic aberrations ( 43, 44 ). Our functional assay system does however provide a robust and easily implementable tool for the functional characterization of large numbers of BRCA1 VUSs within the context of the full-length protein. It is our hope that our assay system will fi nd its way to clinical genetics laboratories where it can be used to aid genetic counseling. Ideally, these tests should be coordinated on an international level and in close collaboration with the ENIGMA consortium.&lt;/th&gt;\n",

Loss-of-function mutations in the PTEN gene are frequent in human cancer and in the germline of patients with PTEN hamartoma tumor-related syndromes (PHTSs). In addition, PTEN is mutated in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), although no functional information on these mutations is available. Here, we report a comprehensive in vivo functional analysis of human PTEN using a heterologous yeast reconstitution system. Ala-scanning mutagenesis at the catalytic loops of PTEN outlined the critical role of residues within the P-catalytic loop for PIP3 phosphatase activity in vivo. PTEN mutations that mimic the P-catalytic loop of mammalian PTEN-like proteins (TPTE, TPIP, tensins and auxilins) affected PTEN function variably, whereas tumor- or PHTS-associated mutations targeting the PTEN P-loop produced complete loss of function. Conversely, Ala-substitutions, as well as tumor-related mutations at the WPD- and TI-catalytic loops, displayed partial activity in many cases. Interestingly, a tumor-related D92N mutation was partially active, supporting the notion that the PTEN Asp92 residue might not function as the catalytic general acid. The analysis of a panel of ASD-associated hereditary PTEN mutations revealed that most of them did not substantially abrogate PTEN activity in vivo, whereas most of PHTS-associated mutations did. Our findings reveal distinctive functional patterns among PTEN mutations found in tumors and in the germline of PHTS and ASD patients, which could be relevant for therapy. Topic: mutation catalysis phosphoric monoester hydrolases yeasts neoplasms pten gene Issue Section: Articles INTRODUCTION  PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10) is a mammalian lipid and protein phosphatase with orthologs in lower animals, plants and fungi (1). In mammals, PTEN-related proteins exist whose activity has been poorly explored. These proteins include TPIP and TPTE (orthologs of a voltage-sensor phosphatase from Ciona intestinalis), as well as the actin-binding tensin 1/2/3 and the clathrin-binding auxilin 1/2 (2â€“4). PTEN most relevant function is based on its ability to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) in the 3â€² phosphate of the inositol ring, resulting in the bisphosphate product phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), thus broadly inhibiting the oncogenic phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent signaling (5â€“8). As a tumor suppressor, PTEN exerts its function by counteracting the anti-apoptotic and growth stimulatory effects of PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase) and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), which rely on PIP3 for their activation (9,10). Sporadic somatic mutations in PTEN make this tumor suppressor gene one of the two most frequently affected in human malignancies, together with p53, especially in solid tumors (11â€“14). Germline mutations of PTEN lead to inherited hamartoma, Cowden syndrome and related disorders, generally known as PTEN hamartoma tumor-related syndromes (PHTSs) (15â€“17). PTEN is considered haploinsufficient to prevent certain malignancies, suggesting that dosage is important for its function, as it must be the influence of a given point mutation in the catalytic activity of the enzyme (18). Besides its clear involvement in PHTS, germline PTEN mutations have been described in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and developmental delay (DD) (19â€“22). Oncogenic PTEN mutations have been generally related to a loss of function of the encoded phosphatase. However, few studies have been done to understand the influence of putative neurodevelopment-related PTEN mutations on its catalytic activity.  Although phosphatase-independent functions of PTEN have also been described to contribute to its tumor suppressive activity (8,23â€“25), buffering PI3K signaling in virtue of its catalytic activity is assumed to be its key role. Thus, the precise dissection of PTEN catalytic properties is highly relevant for human disease. The crystal structure of PTEN (26) revealed an active site pocket similar to those of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and dual-specificity Thr/Ser/Tyr phosphatases, as predicted by primary sequence analyses, although richer in basic residues. This explained the ability of PTEN to dephosphorylate acidic phosphopeptides (27). In addition, the PTEN active site pocket was wider than that of PTPs, to accommodate the rather bulky phosphorylated inositol moiety that constitutes the polar head of PIP3 (26). The PTEN phosphatase signature motif ([123]HCKAGKGR[130]; P-loop), including the catalytic Cys124 and Arg130 residues, is located at the bottom of the active site pocket. The walls of the pocket are delimited in part by a WPD-loop (thus designed after the equivalent region in PTP1B) and a TI-loop (so named because of conserved Thr and Ile residues), which are thought to be important for the activity of the enzyme. The fact that the Asp92, within the PTEN WPD-loop, is located in the pocket in an identical fashion to the equivalent proton donor catalytic residue on PTP1B led to the hypothesis that it may serve as the general acid that allows protonation of the leaving phosphate during the dephosphorylation reaction. Although in vitro studies using an Asp92 to Ala PTEN mutation indicated that Asp92 does not act as the general acid (28,29), no conclusive studies have been done to analyze the contribution of Asp92 in the in vivo dephosphorylation of PIP3 by PTEN.  We have previously validated a humanized yeast model to study the function of PI3K and PTEN in vivo, based on the heterologous co-expression of these proteins (1,30,31). Briefly, expression of hyperactive p110Î±, the catalytic subunit of mammalian class I PI3K, results in high toxicity in yeast cells as a result of the depletion of essential PIP2 pools. Co-expression of PTEN restores PIP2 levels and suppresses PI3K toxicity. Besides, co-expression of GFP-tagged mammalian Akt in this system allowed the detection of pools of PI3K-generated PIP3 in the yeast cell, where Akt localized, providing a visual readout of PI3K and PTEN activities (30,32). Here, we present an extensive site-directed mutagenesis and functional study of PTEN by using this system. Humanized yeast-based bioassays combine the advantages of powerful yeast genetics, an ever-growing availability of post-genomic tools, their ease and safety of manipulation and the fast achievement of results (1). Our results offer insights into the catalytic properties of PTEN and provide a platform to compare in vivo the contribution to lipid phosphatase inactivation of mutations found in tumors and in the germline of patients with PTEN-related syndromes. Our analysis reveals that PTEN germline mutations found in patients with ASD/DD neurodevelopmental disorders do not generally confer complete loss of function of the PTEN PIP3 phosphatase activity, when compared with mutations found in the germline of PHTS patients with tumor disorders.  RESULTS  Ala-scanning of the catalytic loops at the PTEN active site  The PIP3 lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN is essential for its tumor suppressor activity, which is evidenced by the abundance of tumor-related mutations in exons encoding the catalytic phosphatase core of the enzyme (11,15,33). Thus, the precise definition of PIP3 catalytic properties of PTEN in vivo, and its relation with PTEN residues mutated in tumor samples or in patients, is highly relevant in oncology. The PTEN active site is conformed by three catalytic loops (26): the WPD-loop, residues 88â€“98; the P-loop, residues 121â€“131; and the TI-loop, residues 160â€“171 (Fig. 1A). The P-catalytic loop (containing the essential catalytic cysteine; Cys124 in human PTEN) is highly conserved between species, from mammals to lower eukaryotes, whereas the WPD- and TI-loops are more divergent (Fig. 1B). To test the contribution of all individual residues within the three PTEN catalytic loops to the in vivo activity of the enzyme, a comprehensive Ala-scanning mutagenesis was performed. The PIP3 catalytic activity of the resulting mutations was assessed in vivo using a reconstitution heterologous system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (31). As illustrated in Figure 2, Ala substitutions of the residues at the core P-loop (residues 121â€“131) substantially abrogated the PTEN ability to dephosphorylate PIP3in vivo, with the exception of the A121V, G129A and T131A mutations, which displayed partial or total activity (note that Ala residues have been substituted by Val residues in our Ala-scanning mutational analysis). Remarkably, a Cowden disease mutation targeting the Gly129 residue (G129E) is defective for PIP3 phosphatase activity but maintains in vitro activity against phosphotyrosine peptides (34). Overall, the residues at the WPD- and TI-loops were less important for PIP3 catalytic activity. Thus, Ala substitutions of most WPD residues (88â€“98) did not affect, or only partially affected, PTEN catalytic activity, with the exception of Asp92 and His93 that fully abrogated the PTEN function (Fig. 2). Also, Ala substitutions of most TI residues (160â€“171) only weakly affected the PTEN activity, except for Val166, Gln171 and, to some extent, Asp162. (Fig. 2) The loss-of-function properties of the D92A mutation is in accordance with the importance of this residue in PTEN phosphatase catalysis, although its role as the general acid in the hydrolysis reaction remains unclear (28,29).

Functional analysis of mutations at the PTEN P-loop mimicking PTEN-like proteins  PTEN-like proteins include TPIP and TPTE, as well as tensins and auxilins. The WPD- and TI-loops are divergent between PTEN and PTEN-like proteins, whereas the P-loop is more conserved (Fig. 1C). As part of our mutational analysis of the PTEN active site, we designed single amino acid substitution mutants on PTEN that mimicked the P-loop from the different PTEN-like proteins and tested their PIP3 phosphatase activity in the yeast system. Mutations included A121V, I122L, I122V, H123Y, C124N, K125L, K125M, K125R, A126D, A126G, G127N, K128R, K128T, G129D, G129A, R130A, R130K, T131I, T131L and T131S (note that A121V, G129A and R130A mutations are included in Fig. 2). A group of mutations (H123Y, C124N, A126D, G127N, K128T, G129D, R130A, R130K, T131I and T131L) fully abrogated the PIP3 phosphatase activity of PTEN in yeast, whereas other two groups only affected partially (I122L, K125L, K125M, A126G and K128R) or did not affect PTEN PIP3 phosphatase activity (A121V, I122V, K125R, G129A and T131S) (Fig. 3; note that results for A121V, G129A and R130A mutations are included in Fig. 2). The results from this mutational analysis are in agreement with the in vitro PIP3 phosphatase activity reported for TPIP and with the lack of activity reported for TPTE (35). Our results also suggest that the P-loops from tensin and auxilin proteins do not bear catalytic activity. Moreover, this analysis revealed that some conservative mutations at the PTEN P-loop (such as I122V, K125R and T131S) are permissive for its activity in vivo.  Figure 3.

Functional analysis of tumor-related mutations targeting PTEN active site residues  Tumor-related mutations are spread along the entire PTEN amino acid sequence. Nevertheless, the PTEN C-terminal tail (last 50 residues) is targeted by mutations less frequently, in agreement with our previous finding using the yeast heterologous system that PTEN 1â€“349 is the minimal fully functional PTEN protein (30). On the other hand, the core PTP catalytic domain (residues 14â€“185) is more frequently targeted by mutations in either tumors or PHTS patients. Some of these mutations have been analyzed in terms of intrinsic catalytic activity (36â€“40), but the majority of them have not been directly tested for function. We have analyzed in the yeast system the PIP3 phosphatase activity of tumor-related mutations targeting PTEN residues at the PTEN catalytic loops (note that some of these mutations have been analyzed previously and are shown in Figs 2 and 3; and Figs 5 and 6 also include some of them). As expected, all the tumor mutations at the P-loop tested (A121E, I122S, H123D, H123Y, C124S, K125E, A126S, A126V, G127E, K128N, G129E, G129V, G129R, R130G, T131A and T131I) gave rise to proteins that were fully inactive, except for A126S and K128N that produced partially inactive proteins (Fig. 4 and Figs 2 and 3). Mutations at the TI-loop included T160I, R161G, D162G, G165E, G165V, V166I, T167A, I168F, P169H and S170R. Among these, only the T160I, G165E, G165V and S170R were loss-of-function mutations (Fig. 4 and Fig. 2). Finally, tumor-related mutations targeting the WPD loop included Y88C, F90L, E91A, D92A, D92E, D92G, D92H, D92N, D92V, H93D, H93Q, H93R, H93Y, N94I, P95L and P96Q. Proteins bearing Y88C, F90L or E91A mutations were active, whereas the rest of mutant proteins were partially or fully inactive (Fig. 4 and Figs 2, 5 and 6). A summary of the tumor-related PTEN mutants analyzed is shown in Supplementary Material, Table S1. Taken together, our findings illustrate the heterogeneity in the catalytic activity of tumor-related PTEN mutant proteins.  Figure 4.

Relevance of the Asp92 residue in PTEN activity in vivo  Remarkably, a mutation in the putative catalytic Asp92 residue to Asn (D92N) rendered a protein partially active in vivo in the yeast system, whereas substitution of this residue to any of the other 18 amino acids generated fully inactive PTEN enzymes (Fig. 5A). This outlines the importance of Asp92 in PTEN enzymatic activity, but also demonstrates that the presence of an aspartic acid residue at this position is not a strict requirement for PTEN-driven catalysis. To further substantiate this observation, the PIP3 phosphatase activity of the PTEN mutations D92A (non-conservative), D92E (charge-conservative) and D92N (size-conservative), expressed in mammalian cells, was tested both in vitro and in vivo. As shown, the mutations D92A and D92E fully abrogated hydrolysis of PIP3 by PTEN in vitro, whereas the mutation D92N only partially affected it (Fig. 5B). Upon co-expression with Akt, the D92N PTEN mutant also manifested more activity [indirectly measured as the levels of phospho-Akt (p-Akt) content] than the D92A or the D92E mutant proteins (Fig. 5C). Our results suggest that Asp92 does not behave as the general acid in the hydrolysis of PIP3 by PTEN, in vitro and in vivo.  Most of germline PTEN mutations associated with autism syndrome disorders do not fully abrogate PIP3 phosphatase activity  The involvement of PTEN in brain developmental disorders has been proposed on the basis of the identification of hereditary PTEN mutations in patients with these disorders (41,42), but little information is available on the severity of such mutations in terms of PTEN function. One of the mutations present in glioblastoma tumor samples (H93R) has also been found in the germline of a patient with autism (19). When performing the experiments shown above on tumor-related PTEN mutations, we included the H93R and found it to display a modest loss of activity in the yeast model when compared with wild-type PTEN, although it was capable of fully recovering yeast growth (Fig. 6B). This prompted us to examine additional inherited mutations found in patients with autism-related disorders (ASD) or with DD/mental retardation. These mutations included, besides H93R, the G44D, H118P, H123Q, M134T, E157G, R173H, Y176C, T202I, F241S, D252G, W274L, N276S and D326N, involving not only catalytic but other protein domains. Remarkably, proteins bearing most of these mutations were either fully or partially active in the yeast (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Material, Table S1), although their ability to recover growth from PI3K-imposed inhibition was variable. These results were in contrast to those obtained by analyzing the function of a panel of PHTS-associated mutations, also distributed along the entire PTEN coding region (mutations A34D, M35R, G36R, N48K, H61D, Y68D, D92E, H93Y, P96Q, H123D, C124S, G129E, R130G, Y155C, G165E, G165V, S170R, L181P, V217N, P246L, R335L, V343E; L345V and F347L; Fig. 6A and Supplementary Material, Table S1). Most of the PHTS-associated mutations generated total or partial loss of function when analyzed in vivo in yeast. Moreover, global comparison of PHTS- and ASD/DD-related mutations in terms of their ability both to deplete PIP3 generated by PI3K in yeast (Fig. 6C; P &amp;lt; 0.001) and to rescue yeast growth (Fig. 6D) revealed that ASD/DD-related PTEN mutations have a lower effect in PTEN activity than those associated with PHTS. These findings indicate that specific PTEN functional patterns correlate with the mutations found on either PHTS or ASD/DD patients and suggest that a severe loss of the PTEN PIP3 catalytic activity may not be the major driver of autism or autism-related neurological disorders.  DISCUSSION  The PTEN phosphatase is a key regulatory hub of PI3K-mediated signaling. While mammals express a variety of isoforms of PI3K and PIP3-dependent downstream kinases in this pathway, the PTEN tumor suppressor is rather unique, being the only one gene that encodes for a common inactivator of the pathway. Thus, mutations in exons of the PTEN gene are frequent in tumors and hereditary cancer syndromes. The regulation of PTEN is complex, involving multiple processes related to its phosphorylation, ubiquitination, nuclear translocation, interaction with membranes and complexing with different proteins (6,8,24,43,44). Although recent reports point towards PTEN functions independent of its lipid phosphatase activity (23â€“25,45,46), PTEN tumor suppressor function mainly relies on its catalytic activity on PIP3 pools locally generated by PI3K at the plasma membrane. The contribution of PTEN mutations isolated in the clinics to the function of the encoded protein is crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms that lead to tumor development and progression. We have developed a simple model for functional assessment of PTEN mutations based on heterologous expression in yeast (1,31). This model allows ready evaluation of the involvement of PTEN mutations on the ability to counteract PI3K activity in vivo, by compromising PTEN PIP3 catalytic activity or by affecting PTEN protein stability, two common mechanisms by which PTEN is inactivated in tumors (30). Here, we report extensive use of this model with two aims: (i) to provide clues for structureâ€“function relationship by systematic mutagenesis and (ii) to study the influence of individual disease-related PTEN mutations in its lipid phosphatase activity.  From our systematic functional analysis on the PTEN catalytic loops, several conclusions can be driven. First, as expected, the P-loop including the catalytic Cys residue is very sensitive to mutagenesis, in consonance with the observation that it constitutes a hot spot for tumor-related mutations (11,15,33), whereas the WPD and TI loops are more permissive to point Ala substitutions. Still, residues like Asp92 or His93 (WPD-loop), Asp162, Val166 or Gln171 (TI-loop) were critical for function. We made a comprehensive study on tolerance to mutation of the Asp92 residue, equivalent to the acid proton donor involved in catalysis in PTPs that are structurally related to PTEN (47). Tolerance to mutation was very low in this residue, since its substitution to any other amino acid yielded an inactive enzyme, except for Asp-to-Asn substitution, which partially retained activity in vivo, not only in the yeast model but also in mammalian cells. Since the D92N mutation has been reported in the clinic, such reduced activity may substantially contribute to disease. Interestingly, this argues against the need for an acid residue in that position, revealing an alternative mechanism of catalysis for the PTEN phosphatase, as proposed by other authors based on in vitro experiments (28,29). We also made substitutions within the catalytic loops mimicking PTEN-related proteins, such as TPIP, TPTE, tensin and auxilin. Although these proteins possess distinct non-PTP-related domains that control protein targeting, proteinâ€“protein interactions and cell signaling, they share the presence of PTP- and C2-like domains with significant similarity with those from PTEN (2,3,48). With the exception of TPIP, PTEN-like proteins are predicted to be catalytically inactive, due either to the lack of essential residues at the catalytic site or to amino acid substitutions potentially deleterious for catalysis (35,49,50). Nevertheless, tensin2/C1-TEN has been proposed to be an active phosphatase, based on functional studies on a mutation that targets its putative catalytic cysteine residue (51). Our observations favor the hypothesis that the P-loop of TPIP might be competent for activity, whereas TPTE, tensins and auxilins would be inactive as phosphatases, as evidenced in other studies (35,52,53).  A large number of different PTEN mutations have been described in human tumors and in the germline of patients with PHTS or PHTS-related syndromes (11,15,33) [for updates, check HGMD (http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php) and COSMIC (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic) databases]. These mutations target the PTEN gene not only at its coding regions, but also at exonâ€“intron boundaries and promoter regions. Most of PTEN mutations at exonâ€“intron boundaries or promoter regions have a major impact in the levels of expression of the PTEN protein, being causative of PTEN functional deficiency and considered as pathogenic (54â€“56). Mutations targeting the PTEN coding region include frame-shift and nonsense mutations, which also generate unstable truncated PTEN proteins in most of the cases (36), as well as missense mutations that result in individual amino acid changes. Functional analyses of a limited number of these missense mutations have revealed that, in many cases, the resultant amino acid substitutions generate PTEN proteins with impaired intrinsic catalytic activity and/or protein stability (36â€“39). Also, some examples have been described of missense PTEN mutations that do not affect the intrinsic catalysis nor the stability of the protein, but rather impair essential regulatory PTEN properties, such as binding to membranes or nuclear entry (40,57). Our previous study using the heterologous yeast system as a reporter of the activity of PTEN mutations in vivo revealed that such system reproduces with fidelity the effects on mammalian cells of mutations that diminish either the intrinsic PTEN catalytic activity and/or binding to membranes or the intrinsic PTEN protein stability (30). Our current comprehensive functional study of tumor-associated PTEN mutations indicates that almost all mutations targeting the P-catalytic loop confer loss of PTEN intrinsic catalytic activity (12 of 13), whereas mutations targeting the WPD- or the TI-loops are less frequently associated with full loss of catalysis (5 of 9 and 4 of 9, respectively). These results are in agreement with the Ala-scanning analysis of these regions and suggest the existence of a relatively large number of tumor-associated mutations at the PTEN gene that do not fully abrogate the PTEN catalytic activity, but may be relevant in clinics. Recently, a comprehensive study on PTEN mutations in PHTS disease has yielded predictive clinical parameters (58). Association of reported mutations to the activity of PTEN by means of ready in vivo functional assays, as the one exploited here, might help clinicians in decisions towards putative mutation-specific therapies.  PHTS and ASD/DD are syndromes with distinct clinical entities, which share macrocephaly as a frequent common alteration (59). Also, clinicians have noted that PHTS patients often display neurobehavioral features resembling autism (19) and, interestingly, at least five PTEN mutations (H93R, Y176C, F241S, D252G and R173H; see Supplementary Material, Table S1) have been reported as associated with both PHTS and ASD/DD (19,41,42,58). Our comparative analysis of germline mutations found in PHTS patients and in ASD/DD patients revealed a distinct functional pattern for these two groups of mutations. PHTS-associated mutations, which included in our study mutations distributed all along the PTEN protein, were found significantly more deleterious for PTEN catalysis than ASD/DD-associated mutations (Fig. 6). This could be important for the distinct etiology and progress of tumor-related and tumor non-related syndromes associated with PTEN mutations and may be of relevance in the design and implementation of new therapies for these diseases. It is likely that small variations in the lipid phosphatase activity or in the stability of heterozygotic PTEN mutations can explain the higher penetrance found for the set of PHTS-associated mutations, when compared with ASD/DD-associated mutations. Although it has been suggested that ASD- and macrocephaly-related PTEN mutations may behave differentially in terms of loss of function (19), the lack of functional models has made difficult to provide support for this hypothesis. If this is the case, as suggested by our study, additional unknown factors might exist affecting differentially the etiology and/or progression of these diseases. In this regard, a study focused on the functional analysis of the PHTS- and ASD-associated H93R PTEN mutation reported a partial loss of catalytic activity for this mutation, as well as a defect in the binding to PTEN-activating PIP2 model membranes. Remarkably, the binding of the H93R mutation to phosphatidylserine membranes, which are abundant in mammalian cells, was augmented (60). Our results show that the H93R mutation retained most of its lipid phosphatase activity in the yeast, suggesting that differences in the thresholds that control membrane-binding mediated PTEN activation may exist in distinct cell systems. Also of interest, mice with diminution of PTEN expression levels as subtle as 20% develop a wide spectrum of tumors with high penetrance, and it has been proposed that altered gene dosage may be relevant in ASD/DD (18,61). In this regard, ASD/DD has been linked with abnormal synapsis growth and plasticity, an alteration that has also been observed in mice with PTEN-deficient neurons (62,63). Furthermore, a mice model lacking PTEN expression in mature neuronal populations in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus displayed behavioral abnormalities reminiscent of human ASD/DD (64). Our findings show a relatively weak association between ASD/DD-related mutations at the PTEN gene and full loss of intrinsic lipid phosphatase activity or protein stability, which is in line with the lack of concordance between ASD/DD and childhood cancer (65). ASD/DD constitutes a heterogeneous, multigene-linked group of developmental disorders (41,42,66). Further studies will be required to ascertain the functional changes on the activity of the PTEN protein from ASD/DD patients with mutations at the PTEN gene. The comprehensive analysis of the functional properties of putative pathogenic mutant proteins, as the one we present here for PTEN mutations, will give some light on the molecular pathways altered in the neurons of patients with ASD/DD.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Cells, media, growth conditions, transfection and protein detection  The S. cerevisiae strain YPH499 (MATa ade2â€“101 trp1â€“63 leu2â€“1 ura3â€“52 his3-â–µ200 lys2â€“801) was used for heterologous expression of mammalian proteins. For all the analyses, synthetic complete medium was used, containing 0.17 % yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% ammonium sulfate supplemented with appropriate amino acids and nucleic acid bases, and added 2% glucose (SD), galactose (SG) or raffinose (SR), as required. Yeasts were transformed by standard procedures. Growth of yeast on plates was tested by spotting transformant cells onto SD or SG plates lacking the corresponding auxotrophic markers. Transformants were grown overnight in SD lacking uracile, leucine or both (SD-U, SD-L or SD-UL) as required and adjusted to an OD600 of 0.5. Five microliter aliquots of each sample plus three serial 1/10 dilutions were deposited on the surfaces of solid media SG-U, SG-L or SG-UL. Growth was monitored after 2â€“3 days at 30Â°C. Expression of all PTEN mutations in yeast was verified by immunoblot on yeast lysates with 421B or 425A anti-PTEN mAb (67) followed by horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Calbiochem). To measure GFP-Akt1 plasma membrane localization, as an indirect indicator of cellular PIP3 levels, transformant cells were grown to log phase in liquid SR medium lacking the corresponding auxotrophic markers, and then 2 % galactose was added for 6â€“8 h. GFP-Akt1 was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. To obtain statistically significant data, â‰¥100 cells were examined from each condition or experiment for either cytoplasmic or membrane-associated localization. Cells were examined under an Eclipse TE2000U microscope (Nikon) and digital images were acquired with Orca C4742-95-12ER charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu) and Aquacosmos Imaging Systems or HCImage software. To overexpress PTEN mutations in mammalian cells, COS-7 cells (simian kidney) were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method and processed after 48 h. To measure p-Akt content in COS-7 cells in the presence of PTEN mutations, cells were co-transfected with pRK5 PTEN and pSG5 HA-Akt1 as described (68). Cells were lysed, and post-nuclear lysates were subjected by immunoblot using a mixture of anti-p-Thr308 and anti-p-Ser473-Akt antibodies (Cell Signalling Technologies). Membranes were stripped and probed for anti-Akt antibody (Cell Signalling Technologies). Bands were quantified using ImageQuant TL software, and results are represented as the average Â± SD of the p-Akt/Akt ratio.  Plasmids, mutagenesis and in vitro phosphatase assays  YCpLG myc-p110-CAAX, pYES2 PTEN, pRK5 PTEN, pSG5 HA-Akt1 and pYES3 GFP-Akt1 have been described previously (30). Mutagenesis was performed by a two-step PCR strategy. All mutations were checked by DNA sequencing. The sequences of oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are available on request. In vitro phosphatase assays were made using PTEN wild-type or mutations, from COS-7-transfected cells, as the enzymes, and diC8-phosphatydilinositol PIP3 (Echelon) as the substrate, as described previously (30).&quot;&gt;\n",
       "                The PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) phosphatase is unique in mammals in terms of its tumor suppressor activity, exerted by dephosphorylation of the lipid second messenger PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate), which activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) oncogenic pathway. Loss-of-function mutations in the PTEN gene are frequent in human cancer and in the germline of patients with PTEN hamartoma tumor-related syndromes (PHTSs). In addition, PTEN is mutated in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), although no functional information on these mutations is available. Here, we report a comprehensive in vivo functional analysis of human PTEN using a heterologous yeast reconstitution system. Ala-scanning mutagenesis at the catalytic loops of PTEN outlined the critical role of residues within the P-catalytic loop for PIP3 phosphatase activity in vivo. PTEN mutations that mimic the P-catalytic loop of mammalian PTEN-like proteins (TPTE, TPIP, tensins and auxilins) affected PTEN function variably, whereas tumor- or PHTS-associated mutations targeting the PTEN P-loop produced complete loss of function. Conversely, Ala-substitutions, as well as tumor-related mutations at the WPD- and TI-catalytic loops, displayed partial activity in many cases. Interestingly, a tumor-related D92N mutation was partially active, supporting the notion that the PTEN Asp92 residue might not function as the catalytic general acid. The analysis of a panel of ASD-associated hereditary PTEN mutations revealed that most of them did not substantially abrogate PTEN activity in vivo, whereas most of PHTS-associated mutations did. Our findings reveal distinctive functional patterns among PTEN mutations found in tumors and in the germline of PHTS and ASD patients, which could be relevant for therapy. Topic: mutation catalysis phosphoric monoester hydrolases yeasts neoplasms pten gene Issue Section: Articles INTRODUCTION  PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10) is a mammalian lipid and protein phosphatase with orthologs in lower animals, plants and fungi (1). In mammals, PTEN-related proteins exist whose activity has been poorly explored. These proteins include TPIP and TPTE (orthologs of a voltage-sensor phosphatase from Ciona intestinalis), as well as the actin-binding tensin 1/2/3 and the clathrin-binding auxilin 1/2 (2â€“4). PTEN most relevant function is based on its ability to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) in the 3â€² phosphate of the inositol ring, resulting in the bisphosphate product phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), thus broadly inhibiting the oncogenic phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent signaling (5â€“8). As a tumor suppressor, PTEN exerts its function by counteracting the anti-apoptotic and growth stimulatory effects of PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase) and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), which rely on PIP3 for their activation (9,10). Sporadic somatic mutations in PTEN make this tumor suppressor gene one of the two most frequently affected in human malignancies, together with p53, especially in solid tumors (11â€“14). Germline mutations of PTEN lead to inherited hamartoma, Cowden syndrome and related disorders, generally known as PTEN hamartoma tumor-related syndromes (PHTSs) (15â€“17). PTEN is considered haploinsufficient to prevent certain malignancies, suggesting that dosage is important for its function, as it must be the influence of a given point mutation in the catalytic activity of the enzyme (18). Besides its clear involvement in PHTS, germline PTEN mutations have been described in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and developmental delay (DD) (19â€“22). Oncogenic PTEN mutations have been generally related to a loss of function of the encoded phosphatase. However, few studies have been done to understand the influence of putative neurodevelopment-related PTEN mutations on its catalytic activity.  Although phosphatase-independent functions of PTEN have also been described to contribute to its tumor suppressive activity (8,23â€“25), buffering PI3K signaling in virtue of its catalytic activity is assumed to be its key role. Thus, the precise dissection of PTEN catalytic properties is highly relevant for human disease. The crystal structure of PTEN (26) revealed an active site pocket similar to those of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and dual-specificity Thr/Ser/Tyr phosphatases, as predicted by primary sequence analyses, although richer in basic residues. This explained the ability of PTEN to dephosphorylate acidic phosphopeptides (27). In addition, the PTEN active site pocket was wider than that of PTPs, to accommodate the rather bulky phosphorylated inositol moiety that constitutes the polar head of PIP3 (26). The PTEN phosphatase signature motif ([123]HCKAGKGR[130]; P-loop), including the catalytic Cys124 and Arg130 residues, is located at the bottom of the active site pocket. The walls of the pocket are delimited in part by a WPD-loop (thus designed after the equivalent region in PTP1B) and a TI-loop (so named because of conserved Thr and Ile residues), which are thought to be important for the activity of the enzyme. The fact that the Asp92, within the PTEN WPD-loop, is located in the pocket in an identical fashion to the equivalent proton donor catalytic residue on PTP1B led to the hypothesis that it may serve as the general acid that allows protonation of the leaving phosphate during the dephosphorylation reaction. Although in vitro studies using an Asp92 to Ala PTEN mutation indicated that Asp92 does not act as the general acid (28,29), no conclusive studies have been done to analyze the contribution of Asp92 in the in vivo dephosphorylation of PIP3 by PTEN.  We have previously validated a humanized yeast model to study the function of PI3K and PTEN in vivo, based on the heterologous co-expression of these proteins (1,30,31). Briefly, expression of hyperactive p110Î±, the catalytic subunit of mammalian class I PI3K, results in high toxicity in yeast cells as a result of the depletion of essential PIP2 pools. Co-expression of PTEN restores PIP2 levels and suppresses PI3K toxicity. Besides, co-expression of GFP-tagged mammalian Akt in this system allowed the detection of pools of PI3K-generated PIP3 in the yeast cell, where Akt localized, providing a visual readout of PI3K and PTEN activities (30,32). Here, we present an extensive site-directed mutagenesis and functional study of PTEN by using this system. Humanized yeast-based bioassays combine the advantages of powerful yeast genetics, an ever-growing availability of post-genomic tools, their ease and safety of manipulation and the fast achievement of results (1). Our results offer insights into the catalytic properties of PTEN and provide a platform to compare in vivo the contribution to lipid phosphatase inactivation of mutations found in tumors and in the germline of patients with PTEN-related syndromes. Our analysis reveals that PTEN germline mutations found in patients with ASD/DD neurodevelopmental disorders do not generally confer complete loss of function of the PTEN PIP3 phosphatase activity, when compared with mutations found in the germline of PHTS patients with tumor disorders.  RESULTS  Ala-scanning of the catalytic loops at the PTEN active site  The PIP3 lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN is essential for its tumor suppressor activity, which is evidenced by the abundance of tumor-related mutations in exons encoding the catalytic phosphatase core of the enzyme (11,15,33). Thus, the precise definition of PIP3 catalytic properties of PTEN in vivo, and its relation with PTEN residues mutated in tumor samples or in patients, is highly relevant in oncology. The PTEN active site is conformed by three catalytic loops (26): the WPD-loop, residues 88â€“98; the P-loop, residues 121â€“131; and the TI-loop, residues 160â€“171 (Fig. 1A). The P-catalytic loop (containing the essential catalytic cysteine; Cys124 in human PTEN) is highly conserved between species, from mammals to lower eukaryotes, whereas the WPD- and TI-loops are more divergent (Fig. 1B). To test the contribution of all individual residues within the three PTEN catalytic loops to the in vivo activity of the enzyme, a comprehensive Ala-scanning mutagenesis was performed. The PIP3 catalytic activity of the resulting mutations was assessed in vivo using a reconstitution heterologous system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (31). As illustrated in Figure 2, Ala substitutions of the residues at the core P-loop (residues 121â€“131) substantially abrogated the PTEN ability to dephosphorylate PIP3in vivo, with the exception of the A121V, G129A and T131A mutations, which displayed partial or total activity (note that Ala residues have been substituted by Val residues in our Ala-scanning mutational analysis). Remarkably, a Cowden disease mutation targeting the Gly129 residue (G129E) is defective for PIP3 phosphatase activity but maintains in vitro activity against phosphotyrosine peptides (34). Overall, the residues at the WPD- and TI-loops were less important for PIP3 catalytic activity. Thus, Ala substitutions of most WPD residues (88â€“98) did not affect, or only partially affected, PTEN catalytic activity, with the exception of Asp92 and His93 that fully abrogated the PTEN function (Fig. 2). Also, Ala substitutions of most TI residues (160â€“171) only weakly affected the PTEN activity, except for Val166, Gln171 and, to some extent, Asp162. (Fig. 2) The loss-of-function properties of the D92A mutation is in accordance with the importance of this residue in PTEN phosphatase catalysis, although its role as the general acid in the hydrolysis reaction remains unclear (28,29).

Functional analysis of mutations at the PTEN P-loop mimicking PTEN-like proteins  PTEN-like proteins include TPIP and TPTE, as well as tensins and auxilins. The WPD- and TI-loops are divergent between PTEN and PTEN-like proteins, whereas the P-loop is more conserved (Fig. 1C). As part of our mutational analysis of the PTEN active site, we designed single amino acid substitution mutants on PTEN that mimicked the P-loop from the different PTEN-like proteins and tested their PIP3 phosphatase activity in the yeast system. Mutations included A121V, I122L, I122V, H123Y, C124N, K125L, K125M, K125R, A126D, A126G, G127N, K128R, K128T, G129D, G129A, R130A, R130K, T131I, T131L and T131S (note that A121V, G129A and R130A mutations are included in Fig. 2). A group of mutations (H123Y, C124N, A126D, G127N, K128T, G129D, R130A, R130K, T131I and T131L) fully abrogated the PIP3 phosphatase activity of PTEN in yeast, whereas other two groups only affected partially (I122L, K125L, K125M, A126G and K128R) or did not affect PTEN PIP3 phosphatase activity (A121V, I122V, K125R, G129A and T131S) (Fig. 3; note that results for A121V, G129A and R130A mutations are included in Fig. 2). The results from this mutational analysis are in agreement with the in vitro PIP3 phosphatase activity reported for TPIP and with the lack of activity reported for TPTE (35). Our results also suggest that the P-loops from tensin and auxilin proteins do not bear catalytic activity. Moreover, this analysis revealed that some conservative mutations at the PTEN P-loop (such as I122V, K125R and T131S) are permissive for its activity in vivo.  Figure 3.

Functional analysis of tumor-related mutations targeting PTEN active site residues  Tumor-related mutations are spread along the entire PTEN amino acid sequence. Nevertheless, the PTEN C-terminal tail (last 50 residues) is targeted by mutations less frequently, in agreement with our previous finding using the yeast heterologous system that PTEN 1â€“349 is the minimal fully functional PTEN protein (30). On the other hand, the core PTP catalytic domain (residues 14â€“185) is more frequently targeted by mutations in either tumors or PHTS patients. Some of these mutations have been analyzed in terms of intrinsic catalytic activity (36â€“40), but the majority of them have not been directly tested for function. We have analyzed in the yeast system the PIP3 phosphatase activity of tumor-related mutations targeting PTEN residues at the PTEN catalytic loops (note that some of these mutations have been analyzed previously and are shown in Figs 2 and 3; and Figs 5 and 6 also include some of them). As expected, all the tumor mutations at the P-loop tested (A121E, I122S, H123D, H123Y, C124S, K125E, A126S, A126V, G127E, K128N, G129E, G129V, G129R, R130G, T131A and T131I) gave rise to proteins that were fully inactive, except for A126S and K128N that produced partially inactive proteins (Fig. 4 and Figs 2 and 3). Mutations at the TI-loop included T160I, R161G, D162G, G165E, G165V, V166I, T167A, I168F, P169H and S170R. Among these, only the T160I, G165E, G165V and S170R were loss-of-function mutations (Fig. 4 and Fig. 2). Finally, tumor-related mutations targeting the WPD loop included Y88C, F90L, E91A, D92A, D92E, D92G, D92H, D92N, D92V, H93D, H93Q, H93R, H93Y, N94I, P95L and P96Q. Proteins bearing Y88C, F90L or E91A mutations were active, whereas the rest of mutant proteins were partially or fully inactive (Fig. 4 and Figs 2, 5 and 6). A summary of the tumor-related PTEN mutants analyzed is shown in Supplementary Material, Table S1. Taken together, our findings illustrate the heterogeneity in the catalytic activity of tumor-related PTEN mutant proteins.  Figure 4.

Relevance of the Asp92 residue in PTEN activity in vivo  Remarkably, a mutation in the putative catalytic Asp92 residue to Asn (D92N) rendered a protein partially active in vivo in the yeast system, whereas substitution of this residue to any of the other 18 amino acids generated fully inactive PTEN enzymes (Fig. 5A). This outlines the importance of Asp92 in PTEN enzymatic activity, but also demonstrates that the presence of an aspartic acid residue at this position is not a strict requirement for PTEN-driven catalysis. To further substantiate this observation, the PIP3 phosphatase activity of the PTEN mutations D92A (non-conservative), D92E (charge-conservative) and D92N (size-conservative), expressed in mammalian cells, was tested both in vitro and in vivo. As shown, the mutations D92A and D92E fully abrogated hydrolysis of PIP3 by PTEN in vitro, whereas the mutation D92N only partially affected it (Fig. 5B). Upon co-expression with Akt, the D92N PTEN mutant also manifested more activity [indirectly measured as the levels of phospho-Akt (p-Akt) content] than the D92A or the D92E mutant proteins (Fig. 5C). Our results suggest that Asp92 does not behave as the general acid in the hydrolysis of PIP3 by PTEN, in vitro and in vivo.  Most of germline PTEN mutations associated with autism syndrome disorders do not fully abrogate PIP3 phosphatase activity  The involvement of PTEN in brain developmental disorders has been proposed on the basis of the identification of hereditary PTEN mutations in patients with these disorders (41,42), but little information is available on the severity of such mutations in terms of PTEN function. One of the mutations present in glioblastoma tumor samples (H93R) has also been found in the germline of a patient with autism (19). When performing the experiments shown above on tumor-related PTEN mutations, we included the H93R and found it to display a modest loss of activity in the yeast model when compared with wild-type PTEN, although it was capable of fully recovering yeast growth (Fig. 6B). This prompted us to examine additional inherited mutations found in patients with autism-related disorders (ASD) or with DD/mental retardation. These mutations included, besides H93R, the G44D, H118P, H123Q, M134T, E157G, R173H, Y176C, T202I, F241S, D252G, W274L, N276S and D326N, involving not only catalytic but other protein domains. Remarkably, proteins bearing most of these mutations were either fully or partially active in the yeast (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Material, Table S1), although their ability to recover growth from PI3K-imposed inhibition was variable. These results were in contrast to those obtained by analyzing the function of a panel of PHTS-associated mutations, also distributed along the entire PTEN coding region (mutations A34D, M35R, G36R, N48K, H61D, Y68D, D92E, H93Y, P96Q, H123D, C124S, G129E, R130G, Y155C, G165E, G165V, S170R, L181P, V217N, P246L, R335L, V343E; L345V and F347L; Fig. 6A and Supplementary Material, Table S1). Most of the PHTS-associated mutations generated total or partial loss of function when analyzed in vivo in yeast. Moreover, global comparison of PHTS- and ASD/DD-related mutations in terms of their ability both to deplete PIP3 generated by PI3K in yeast (Fig. 6C; P &amp;lt; 0.001) and to rescue yeast growth (Fig. 6D) revealed that ASD/DD-related PTEN mutations have a lower effect in PTEN activity than those associated with PHTS. These findings indicate that specific PTEN functional patterns correlate with the mutations found on either PHTS or ASD/DD patients and suggest that a severe loss of the PTEN PIP3 catalytic activity may not be the major driver of autism or autism-related neurological disorders.  DISCUSSION  The PTEN phosphatase is a key regulatory hub of PI3K-mediated signaling. While mammals express a variety of isoforms of PI3K and PIP3-dependent downstream kinases in this pathway, the PTEN tumor suppressor is rather unique, being the only one gene that encodes for a common inactivator of the pathway. Thus, mutations in exons of the PTEN gene are frequent in tumors and hereditary cancer syndromes. The regulation of PTEN is complex, involving multiple processes related to its phosphorylation, ubiquitination, nuclear translocation, interaction with membranes and complexing with different proteins (6,8,24,43,44). Although recent reports point towards PTEN functions independent of its lipid phosphatase activity (23â€“25,45,46), PTEN tumor suppressor function mainly relies on its catalytic activity on PIP3 pools locally generated by PI3K at the plasma membrane. The contribution of PTEN mutations isolated in the clinics to the function of the encoded protein is crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms that lead to tumor development and progression. We have developed a simple model for functional assessment of PTEN mutations based on heterologous expression in yeast (1,31). This model allows ready evaluation of the involvement of PTEN mutations on the ability to counteract PI3K activity in vivo, by compromising PTEN PIP3 catalytic activity or by affecting PTEN protein stability, two common mechanisms by which PTEN is inactivated in tumors (30). Here, we report extensive use of this model with two aims: (i) to provide clues for structureâ€“function relationship by systematic mutagenesis and (ii) to study the influence of individual disease-related PTEN mutations in its lipid phosphatase activity.  From our systematic functional analysis on the PTEN catalytic loops, several conclusions can be driven. First, as expected, the P-loop including the catalytic Cys residue is very sensitive to mutagenesis, in consonance with the observation that it constitutes a hot spot for tumor-related mutations (11,15,33), whereas the WPD and TI loops are more permissive to point Ala substitutions. Still, residues like Asp92 or His93 (WPD-loop), Asp162, Val166 or Gln171 (TI-loop) were critical for function. We made a comprehensive study on tolerance to mutation of the Asp92 residue, equivalent to the acid proton donor involved in catalysis in PTPs that are structurally related to PTEN (47). Tolerance to mutation was very low in this residue, since its substitution to any other amino acid yielded an inactive enzyme, except for Asp-to-Asn substitution, which partially retained activity in vivo, not only in the yeast model but also in mammalian cells. Since the D92N mutation has been reported in the clinic, such reduced activity may substantially contribute to disease. Interestingly, this argues against the need for an acid residue in that position, revealing an alternative mechanism of catalysis for the PTEN phosphatase, as proposed by other authors based on in vitro experiments (28,29). We also made substitutions within the catalytic loops mimicking PTEN-related proteins, such as TPIP, TPTE, tensin and auxilin. Although these proteins possess distinct non-PTP-related domains that control protein targeting, proteinâ€“protein interactions and cell signaling, they share the presence of PTP- and C2-like domains with significant similarity with those from PTEN (2,3,48). With the exception of TPIP, PTEN-like proteins are predicted to be catalytically inactive, due either to the lack of essential residues at the catalytic site or to amino acid substitutions potentially deleterious for catalysis (35,49,50). Nevertheless, tensin2/C1-TEN has been proposed to be an active phosphatase, based on functional studies on a mutation that targets its putative catalytic cysteine residue (51). Our observations favor the hypothesis that the P-loop of TPIP might be competent for activity, whereas TPTE, tensins and auxilins would be inactive as phosphatases, as evidenced in other studies (35,52,53).  A large number of different PTEN mutations have been described in human tumors and in the germline of patients with PHTS or PHTS-related syndromes (11,15,33) [for updates, check HGMD (http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php) and COSMIC (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic) databases]. These mutations target the PTEN gene not only at its coding regions, but also at exonâ€“intron boundaries and promoter regions. Most of PTEN mutations at exonâ€“intron boundaries or promoter regions have a major impact in the levels of expression of the PTEN protein, being causative of PTEN functional deficiency and considered as pathogenic (54â€“56). Mutations targeting the PTEN coding region include frame-shift and nonsense mutations, which also generate unstable truncated PTEN proteins in most of the cases (36), as well as missense mutations that result in individual amino acid changes. Functional analyses of a limited number of these missense mutations have revealed that, in many cases, the resultant amino acid substitutions generate PTEN proteins with impaired intrinsic catalytic activity and/or protein stability (36â€“39). Also, some examples have been described of missense PTEN mutations that do not affect the intrinsic catalysis nor the stability of the protein, but rather impair essential regulatory PTEN properties, such as binding to membranes or nuclear entry (40,57). Our previous study using the heterologous yeast system as a reporter of the activity of PTEN mutations in vivo revealed that such system reproduces with fidelity the effects on mammalian cells of mutations that diminish either the intrinsic PTEN catalytic activity and/or binding to membranes or the intrinsic PTEN protein stability (30). Our current comprehensive functional study of tumor-associated PTEN mutations indicates that almost all mutations targeting the P-catalytic loop confer loss of PTEN intrinsic catalytic activity (12 of 13), whereas mutations targeting the WPD- or the TI-loops are less frequently associated with full loss of catalysis (5 of 9 and 4 of 9, respectively). These results are in agreement with the Ala-scanning analysis of these regions and suggest the existence of a relatively large number of tumor-associated mutations at the PTEN gene that do not fully abrogate the PTEN catalytic activity, but may be relevant in clinics. Recently, a comprehensive study on PTEN mutations in PHTS disease has yielded predictive clinical parameters (58). Association of reported mutations to the activity of PTEN by means of ready in vivo functional assays, as the one exploited here, might help clinicians in decisions towards putative mutation-specific therapies.  PHTS and ASD/DD are syndromes with distinct clinical entities, which share macrocephaly as a frequent common alteration (59). Also, clinicians have noted that PHTS patients often display neurobehavioral features resembling autism (19) and, interestingly, at least five PTEN mutations (H93R, Y176C, F241S, D252G and R173H; see Supplementary Material, Table S1) have been reported as associated with both PHTS and ASD/DD (19,41,42,58). Our comparative analysis of germline mutations found in PHTS patients and in ASD/DD patients revealed a distinct functional pattern for these two groups of mutations. PHTS-associated mutations, which included in our study mutations distributed all along the PTEN protein, were found significantly more deleterious for PTEN catalysis than ASD/DD-associated mutations (Fig. 6). This could be important for the distinct etiology and progress of tumor-related and tumor non-related syndromes associated with PTEN mutations and may be of relevance in the design and implementation of new therapies for these diseases. It is likely that small variations in the lipid phosphatase activity or in the stability of heterozygotic PTEN mutations can explain the higher penetrance found for the set of PHTS-associated mutations, when compared with ASD/DD-associated mutations. Although it has been suggested that ASD- and macrocephaly-related PTEN mutations may behave differentially in terms of loss of function (19), the lack of functional models has made difficult to provide support for this hypothesis. If this is the case, as suggested by our study, additional unknown factors might exist affecting differentially the etiology and/or progression of these diseases. In this regard, a study focused on the functional analysis of the PHTS- and ASD-associated H93R PTEN mutation reported a partial loss of catalytic activity for this mutation, as well as a defect in the binding to PTEN-activating PIP2 model membranes. Remarkably, the binding of the H93R mutation to phosphatidylserine membranes, which are abundant in mammalian cells, was augmented (60). Our results show that the H93R mutation retained most of its lipid phosphatase activity in the yeast, suggesting that differences in the thresholds that control membrane-binding mediated PTEN activation may exist in distinct cell systems. Also of interest, mice with diminution of PTEN expression levels as subtle as 20% develop a wide spectrum of tumors with high penetrance, and it has been proposed that altered gene dosage may be relevant in ASD/DD (18,61). In this regard, ASD/DD has been linked with abnormal synapsis growth and plasticity, an alteration that has also been observed in mice with PTEN-deficient neurons (62,63). Furthermore, a mice model lacking PTEN expression in mature neuronal populations in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus displayed behavioral abnormalities reminiscent of human ASD/DD (64). Our findings show a relatively weak association between ASD/DD-related mutations at the PTEN gene and full loss of intrinsic lipid phosphatase activity or protein stability, which is in line with the lack of concordance between ASD/DD and childhood cancer (65). ASD/DD constitutes a heterogeneous, multigene-linked group of developmental disorders (41,42,66). Further studies will be required to ascertain the functional changes on the activity of the PTEN protein from ASD/DD patients with mutations at the PTEN gene. The comprehensive analysis of the functional properties of putative pathogenic mutant proteins, as the one we present here for PTEN mutations, will give some light on the molecular pathways altered in the neurons of patients with ASD/DD.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Cells, media, growth conditions, transfection and protein detection  The S. cerevisiae strain YPH499 (MATa ade2â€“101 trp1â€“63 leu2â€“1 ura3â€“52 his3-â–µ200 lys2â€“801) was used for heterologous expression of mammalian proteins. For all the analyses, synthetic complete medium was used, containing 0.17 % yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% ammonium sulfate supplemented with appropriate amino acids and nucleic acid bases, and added 2% glucose (SD), galactose (SG) or raffinose (SR), as required. Yeasts were transformed by standard procedures. Growth of yeast on plates was tested by spotting transformant cells onto SD or SG plates lacking the corresponding auxotrophic markers. Transformants were grown overnight in SD lacking uracile, leucine or both (SD-U, SD-L or SD-UL) as required and adjusted to an OD600 of 0.5. Five microliter aliquots of each sample plus three serial 1/10 dilutions were deposited on the surfaces of solid media SG-U, SG-L or SG-UL. Growth was monitored after 2â€“3 days at 30Â°C. Expression of all PTEN mutations in yeast was verified by immunoblot on yeast lysates with 421B or 425A anti-PTEN mAb (67) followed by horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Calbiochem). To measure GFP-Akt1 plasma membrane localization, as an indirect indicator of cellular PIP3 levels, transformant cells were grown to log phase in liquid SR medium lacking the corresponding auxotrophic markers, and then 2 % galactose was added for 6â€“8 h. GFP-Akt1 was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. To obtain statistically significant data, â‰¥100 cells were examined from each condition or experiment for either cytoplasmic or membrane-associated localization. Cells were examined under an Eclipse TE2000U microscope (Nikon) and digital images were acquired with Orca C4742-95-12ER charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu) and Aquacosmos Imaging Systems or HCImage software. To overexpress PTEN mutations in mammalian cells, COS-7 cells (simian kidney) were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method and processed after 48 h. To measure p-Akt content in COS-7 cells in the presence of PTEN mutations, cells were co-transfected with pRK5 PTEN and pSG5 HA-Akt1 as described (68). Cells were lysed, and post-nuclear lysates were subjected by immunoblot using a mixture of anti-p-Thr308 and anti-p-Ser473-Akt antibodies (Cell Signalling Technologies). Membranes were stripped and probed for anti-Akt antibody (Cell Signalling Technologies). Bands were quantified using ImageQuant TL software, and results are represented as the average Â± SD of the p-Akt/Akt ratio.  Plasmids, mutagenesis and in vitro phosphatase assays  YCpLG myc-p110-CAAX, pYES2 PTEN, pRK5 PTEN, pSG5 HA-Akt1 and pYES3 GFP-Akt1 have been described previously (30). Mutagenesis was performed by a two-step PCR strategy. All mutations were checked by DNA sequencing. The sequences of oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are available on request. In vitro phosphatase assays were made using PTEN wild-type or mutations, from COS-7-transfected cells, as the enzymes, and diC8-phosphatydilinositol PIP3 (Echelon) as the substrate, as described previously (30).\n",

       "            &lt;td class=&quot;fillremaining&quot; title=&quot;Mutation screening of the breast and ovarian cancerâ€“predisposition genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 is becoming an increasingly important part of clinical practice. Classification of rare nontruncating sequence variants in these genes is problematic, because it is not known whether these subtle changes alter function sufficiently to predispose cells to cancer development. Using data from the Myriad Genetic Laboratories database of nearly 70,000 full-sequence tests, we assessed the clinical significance of 1,433 sequence variants of unknown significance (VUSs) in the BRCA genes. Three independent measures were employed in the assessment: co-occurrence in trans of a VUS with known deleterious mutations; detailed analysis, by logistic regression, of personal and family history of cancer in VUS-carrying probands; and, in a subset of probands, an analysis of cosegregation with disease in pedigrees. For each of these factors, a likelihood ratio was computed under the hypothesis that the VUSs were equivalent to an â€œaverageâ€� deleterious mutation, compared with neutral, with respect to risk. The likelihood ratios derived from each component were combined to provide an overall assessment for each VUS. A total of 133 VUSs had odds of at least 100:1 in favor of neutrality with respect to risk, whereas 43 had odds of at least 20:1 in favor of being deleterious. VUSs with evidence in favor of causality were those that were predicted to affect splicing, fell at positions that are highly conserved among BRCA orthologs, and were more likely to be located in specific domains of the proteins. In addition to their utility for improved genetics counseling of patients and their families, the global assessment reported here will be invaluable for validation of functional assays, structural models, and in silico analyses.Sequence-based testing for BRCA1 (MIM 113705) and BRCA2(MIM 600185) mutations is now widely available through both commercial laboratories and research studies. Whereas thousands of BRCA1 and BRCA2 truncating mutations have been associated with increased risk of cancer in carriers, the contribution of other BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequence variants to cancer risk remains largely undefined. These â€œvariants of unknown significanceâ€� (VUSs) are mainly missense mutations but also include a number of intronic variants and inframe deletions and insertions (IFDIs). The open-access online Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) Database, which functions as a repository of sequence alterations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, contains &amp;gt;1,500 distinct sequence variants that are currently reported as having unknown clinical significance. To date, classification of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 VUSs as cancer predisposing or neutral has proven problematic, because it is not known whether these subtle changes alter the function of the proteins sufficiently to predispose to cancer. Determination of their disease relevance on the basis of population or family studies has also proved difficult, because most of the alleles encoding these mutations are very rare and, in some cases, population specific. Although identified in a minority (5%â€“10%) of individuals tested clinically, the number of such tests performed annually worldwide means that a large number of women (and their families) are affected by the VUS issue. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that minority ethnic populations are disproportionately affected. VUSs in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes pose significant problems, because patients and physicians do not know whether the VUSs predispose to cancer or are neutral with respect to cancer risk. As a result, carriers of VUSs and their family members cannot take advantage of the risk assessment, prevention, and therapeutic measures that are available to carriers of known deleterious truncating mutations. 1 In addition, carriers of VUSs are sometimes counseled to undergo prophylactic oophorectomy or mastectomy because of the presence of the VUS, but in the absence of any knowledge of the cancer relevance of the VUS. For these reasons, the determination of the clinical relevance of VUSs in BRCA1 and BRCA2 has become an important clinical issue. Although the focus of this article is on BRCA1 and BRCA2, similar concerns and issues are found in virtually all complex, genetically heterogeneous diseases for which genetic testing is performedâ€”for example, colon cancer associated with mutations in mismatch repair genes. 2To address the problem of defining which VUSs are deleterious/disease causing and which are neutral, various types of evidence and classification schemes have been proposed.3; 4 ;  5 These include formal assessment of the cosegregation of the variant with disease in pedigrees,6; 7 ;  8 co-occurrence of the variant in question in trans with a known deleterious mutation, 9 and a number of in silico approaches that evaluate phylogenetic conservation and severity of the amino acid substitution. 10; 11 ;  12 In studies of other genes, evolutionary sequence-conservation analysis involving protein multiple-sequence alignments have been used to show that missense variants (MVs) at highly conserved/invariant residues are more often deleterious, whereas highly variable changes are more likely neutral. 13 ;  14 For BRCA1, Abkevich et al.10 developed a predictive algorithm that combines a measure of cross-species conservation, including nonmammalian BRCA1 sequences, with a measure of the degree of chemical change in amino acids, 15 to identify 50 putative deleterious BRCA1 missense mutations.A number of VUSs have been examined, in terms of their effect on protein, with use of functional assays. Efforts in this area have focused on BRCA1 mutations in the two C-terminal BRCT domains, 16 ;  17 which assess the transcriptional activation activity of the BRCT domains with use of mammalian and yeast-based models, 18; 19 ;  20 and on the E3 ligase activity associated with the N-terminal BARD1-binding domain of BRCA1.21 Examination of BRCA2 function has focused on assays of homology-directed repair and centrosome amplification in response to ectopic expression of full-length, wild-type VUS containing BRCA2 protein.22 Recently, crystal structures of the BRCA1 BRCT and BRCA2 DNA-binding domains have been used to predict that a number of VUSs predispose to cancer, 23; 24 ;  25 but genetic evidence suggests that some of these predictions are incorrect. Although none of the approaches described above have successfully been used to classify the clinical relevance of BRCA1 or BRCA2 VUSs, a number have shown promise in this regard. The development of methods based on functional assays, crystal structure, phylogenetic and sequence analyses, and other approaches has been hampered by the absence of a large number of VUSs that have been proven to be either deleterious or neutral on the basis of direct genetic evidence that can be used in validation of these various assays.In this article, we examine the genetic evidence for or against disease causality for a large number of variants, with use of a large database of tested individuals collected by Myriad Genetic Laboratories. In addition to analysis of co-occurrence of VUSs with established deleterious mutations and the analysis of VUS cosegregation in individual pedigrees, we apply a novel analysis of personal and family cancer history, using data on &amp;gt;70,000 individuals, to assess the clinical significance of 1,433 distinct sequence variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2.MethodsSource of Data and Variants AnalyzedThe data analyzed for this article come from the large database of full-sequence testing for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, performed at Myriad Genetic Laboratories. Since our primary focus was on the analysis of personal and family history, we began with all 70,071 individuals receiving full-sequence tests as of December 2005. To avoid potential confusion over which part of the personal/family history was due to which variant, this data set was reduced by eliminating all individuals who had more than one reported sequence variant (including both VUS and pathogenic mutations), which resulted in a set of 61,270 individuals with at most a single BRCA1 or BRCA2 sequence variant. We then divided the family history data set into several ethnic groups, since we postulated that probands of different ethnic backgrounds are expected to present with different distributions of mutations and different distributions of personal and family histories of cancer. After examining the data set with use of some preliminary logistic regressions to examine heterogeneity as a function of reported ethnicity, we constructed three separate groups that had similar family-history and mutation-prevalence profiles. These groups were: (a) western European, central/eastern European, other/none specified, Native American, and Asian; (b) Ashkenazi Jewish; and (c) Latin American/Caribbean and African American. In the first group, 72% were of European ancestry, 24% did not specify an ethnicity, and 4% were reported as of Asian, Middle Eastern, or Native American origin. Individual probands who reported mixed ancestry between these broad groups (e.g., Western European and Caribbean) were not included in the final data set, leaving 60,529 individual probands for analyses of family history. Table 1 shows the distribution by ethnicity and testing results of these individuals. A total of 1,433 distinct unclassified variants in 4,623 tested probands were identified through sequencing and are the subject of this article.Table 1.Results of Full BRCA Sequence Analysis of 60,529 Tested ProbandsNo. (%) of Subjects with GenotypeEthnic Group\tWild Type\tNeutral\tVUS\tBRCA1 Deletion\tBRCA2 DeletionEuropeana\t41,899 (78.6)\t1,993 (3.7)\t3,972 (7.5)\t3,102 (5.8)\t2,334 (4.4)Ashkenazi Jewish\t3,622 (80.6)\t381 (8.5)\t258 (5.7)\t139 (3.1)\t91 (2.0)African American/Caribbean\tâ€‚1,667 (60.9)\t398 (14.5)\t393 (14.3)\t176 (6.4)\t104 (3.8)â€ƒTotal\t47,188 (78.0)\t2,772 (4.6)\t4,623 (7.6)\t3,417 (5.6)\t2,529 (4.2)aSee the text for the description of ethnicity for this group.Table optionsAs before,3 we assumed that all variants can be classified as deleterious mutations (M) or neutral variants (V). Our aim was to calculate a likelihood ratio (LR) of the formView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onfor each variant, given the available data. These ratios (or Bayes factors) can be combined with prior probabilities to obtain an absolute probability that each variant is deleterious. In this work, we first focused on the data sources that are most straightforwardly quantifiable from pedigree data: co-occurrence with known deleterious mutations, family history, and cosegregation. These three sources of data are independent, and the LR can therefore be derived by multiplying the LRs from the three components. We then used an admixture model to examine the influence of the type of mutation.Co-Occurrence with Known Deleterious MutationsTo include information on the co-occurrence of a VUS in trans phase with a deleterious mutation as evidence against the variant being disease causing, we followed the likelihood-ratio calculation described in our previous work. 3 We assumed that, for BRCA1, compound heterozygotes for two deleterious mutations are vanishingly rare (occur in the testing population with a frequency of 1 in 10,000), given both biological and genetic evidence that homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for deleterious BRCA1 mutations are embryonically lethal, 26 ;  27 whereas, for BRCA2, we assumed that the probability is 1 in 1,000, the increased frequency reflecting the fact that viable compound heterozygotes have been reported as Fanconi anemia, type D1. 28 ;  29 For these analyses, we used an updated data set based on âˆ¼100,000 tests with observed frequencies of BRCA1 and BRCA2 deleterious mutations of 6.6% and 5.0%, respectively. The phase of the VUS with an observed deleterious mutation was determined through examination of haplotypes of common polymorphisms known in other examples of each variant or when the VUS and the deleterious mutation were in the same PCR fragment, as determined by direct examination of the sequence traces. In some cases, phase could not be determined, and we assumed that the first deleterious mutation was in cis phase and that subsequent different deleterious mutations were in trans phase. The LR for deleterious versus neutral is expressed asView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onwhere n is the total number of times the variant was observed, k is the number of those that were in trans with a known deleterious mutation, p1 is the overall frequency of pathogenic mutations in the data set, and p2 is the probability of being a compound heterozygote for two pathogenic mutations (e.g., p1=0.066 and p2=1/10,000).Of the 1,433 VUSs studied here, 476 were observed at least five times, and 248 had at least 10 occurrences. Of the 1,433 variants, 44 were observed to occur with at least one deleterious mutation.Classification by Personal and Family History of Tested ProbandsWe developed likelihood models on the basis of family history,3 which, given the availability of the large Myriad Genetic Laboratories data set, is an extremely powerful tool for classification of VUSs. The method is based on the difference in personal and family-history profiles between individuals found to carry a true deleterious mutation and those with a wild-type BRCA sequence. The rationale is that mutation prevalence is known to be strongly dependent on certain key factors (e.g., disease status of the proband, age at diagnosis, and number and age of relatives with breast cancer [BRCA] or ovarian cancer), so these characteristics should also predict the probability of a new disease-causing missense mutation, whereas that of a neutral mutation should be independent of family history.We suppose that we have a set of probands drawn from a population with a certain distribution of family history. Suppose first that family history is classified into n types. Let pj be the probability that an individual with a mutation has family history type j, whereas qj is the corresponding probability for neutral variants. For a VUS that is deleterious, the predicted distribution of family history should be the same as that for known pathogenic mutations. The LR for a VUS with family history in category j drawn from the same population is thereforeView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onwhere {FH} is the set of all family histories in the study population. In theory, the probabilities pj and qj could be calculated from the proportions of individuals with each category of family history who are found to carry a deleterious mutation. In practice, however, there are large numbers of possible constellations of family history, and the numbers of mutations in some categories would be very small. Instead, we estimated these probabilities by fitting a logistic-regression model. Thus, we fitted a model in which the outcome was the occurrence of a deleterious mutation versus a normal sequence, and summaries of personal and family history were included as covariates.This model then provides predicted probabilities rk that individual k is a mutation carrier, given his or her FH, isrk=P(M|{FH}k)â€‰â€Šâ€Š.Turn MathJax onLet r0 be the corresponding probability under the null hypothesis that the mutation is unrelated to family history or, equivalently, the prior probability of a deleterious mutation in the population. This is estimated by the overall proportion of individuals who have a deleterious mutation (rather than a normal sequence). For example, with use of the data in table 1, for the European group for BRCA1,View the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onThenView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onandView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onTherefore, the required LR isView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onthat is, the odds ratio (OR) of the predicted probability that the individual with the given family history is a mutation carrier against the corresponding probability under the null hypothesis. Where there are multiple individuals with the same VUS, the LRs can be multiplied. We note that this formulation implicitly assumes that all pathogenic mutations in the same gene confer identical risksâ€”that is, that there is no allelic heterogeneity.To implement this analysis, the logistic-regression model was fitted separately for each ethnic group and separately for BRCA1 and BRCA2. To construct a predictive model to be applied to the VUS probands, we used a logistic-regression model within each ethnic group, comparing the personal and family histories of individuals with known deleterious sequences versus those with normal sequences.

The predicted probabilities pk were obtained using the â€œpredictâ€� option in STATA.As a simple validation of the process outline above, we examined the family history ORs for the known deleterious variants. Of the 1,106 distinct deleterious variants examined, 123 had odds of &amp;gt;100:1 in favor of being deleterious, 216 had odds of &amp;gt;10:1, and no known variants were excluded at this same threshold. Although we recognize that these summaries may overstate the modelâ€™s out-of-sample predictive ability, since the deleterious variants were used to construct the logistic regressions, they do provide reassurance that, in general, the method is performing as we expected. Further confirmation of this is obtained by looking at the similar calculation for 44 variants already classified as neutral and not used in either the logistic regression or in the subsequent analysis of VUSs. Of these 44 variants, 33 had odds against being deleterious of &amp;gt;100:1, and the other 11 all had odds against being deleterious of a lesser magnitude.Cosegregation of VUSs in PedigreesElsewhere, we developed a general-pedigree likelihood method for evaluating cosegregation of variants with disease in families that can be used to assess disease causality for unclassified sequence variants.6 The pedigree likelihood is evaluated under the hypothesis that the variant under consideration has the same penetrance as the â€œaverageâ€� known deleterious mutation, compared with the hypothesis that the variant segregates independent of disease in the pedigree(s) under study.As part of an effort to assess the clinical significance of VUSs, individuals found, through the full-sequence testing by Myriad Genetic Laboratories, to carry a VUS are offered free testing of additional family members on a research basis. These additional individuals can be unaffected or affected with BRCA or ovarian cancer and can be male or female. Typically, only 10% of individual probands with VUS provide such samples, and, in most cases, only one or two samples per family are obtained. The pedigree information available in the Myriad Genetic Laboratories database is somewhat descriptive in nature, and, for this reason, we used a simplified model of BRCA1/2 penetrance, with seven liability classes corresponding to (1) unaffected and aged &amp;lt;20 years (or male), (2) unaffected and aged 21â€“49 years, (3) unaffected and aged â©¾50 years, (4) affected with BRCA at age &amp;lt;50 years, (5) affected with BRCA at age â©¾50, (6) affected with ovarian cancer at age &amp;lt;50, and (7) affected with ovarian cancer at age â©¾50. For each liability class, penetrance values were taken from the 2003 study of Antoniou et al., 30 by collapsing the incidence rates across the broader categories used in that study. These pedigrees were then analyzed using a modification of the LINKAGE package,31 as described by Thompson et al.,4 to obtain the required LR.Because the analysis of cosegregation relies on the distribution of the additional genotype data in the pedigree, conditional on the pedigree (including the proband) phenotypes, it is statistically independent from the family/personal information. Similarly, the co-occurrence data is independent from the other two sources, since individuals who also have known deleterious mutations are not considered in these analyses. Thus, the three individual LRs can be multiplied to arrive at a combined LR.Evaluation of Heterogeneity by Variant ClassTo estimate the proportion of mutations in the data set that are likely to be clinically significant as a function of location, conservation, class, etc., we performed a heterogeneity analysis analogous to that routinely used in linkage analysis. Specifically, the required likelihood is given byView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onThis likelihood (in practice, the log likelihood) is then maximized over Î±, and 95% CIs were constructed by finding those values of 2ln(likelihood) that differed by &amp;lt;3.84 from the maximum value. Hypotheses regarding differences in values of Î± as a function of partitions of the total variant space are performed using likelihood-ratio tests.The 1,433 variants were subdivided into the following groups:1.â€‚Variants that changed the resulting proteinâ€”for example, MVs and IFDIs;2.â€‚Variants that were extremely likely, on the basis of studies of many genes and experimental data, to affect splicing, defined for our purposes as (a) all IVSÂ±Â½ or (b) if the last nucleotide of the exon is G and if the first five bases of the subsequent intron are not GTRAG. Note that the latter set includes some missense mutations as well as silent substitutions; mutations that were missense changes as well as splice variants were counted only in the splice variant group.3.â€‚Other variants, consisting primarily of intronic variants not located within 2 bp of the intron/exon splice junction, exonic variants likely to affect splicing but not meeting the strict definition above, and also a small number of variants in the 5â€² UTRs and truncating variants at the extreme 3â€² end of the genes.For the missense/IFDI category, we further subdivided the variants by their location within one of two recognized functional domains of the proteins: the C-terminus region containing the BRCA1 BRCT repeats, defined loosely here as â€œamino acids 1396â€“1862,â€� and the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 2500â€“3098). We also categorized these variants according to whether the wild-type residue involved in the substitution/deletion was evolutionarily conserved through the pufferfish Tetraodon, using multiple-sequence alignments constructed by S.V.T. 10 and available on the Align GVGD Web site. In the case of three inframe insertions, these were denoted as â€œconservedâ€� if the alignment across species was stable in the region surrounding the location of the insertion.Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 9.0 (StataCorp). The heterogeneity analysis was performed using the R programming language.ResultsWe first built the logistic-regression model comparing probands found with wild-type BRCA sequence with those with known deleterious mutations, using the factors detailed in the â€œ Methodsâ€� section. As might be expected with the very large sample sizes used in the analysis, the logistic regressions were highly significant with good predictive power; areas under the ROC curve were âˆ¼0.80 for BRCA1 and âˆ¼0.70 for BRCA2. Not surprisingly, the most highly significant predictive factors associated with a deleterious BRCA1 mutation were associated with personal and family history of ovarian cancer, with high ORs for early-onset BRCA as well. For BRCA2, the most important factors were a personal history of male BRCA and personal/family history of early-onset BRCA. Interestingly a strong family history of BRCA diagnosed after age 50 years was associated with an increased probability of having a BRCA2 mutation but a decreased risk of carrying a BRCA1 deleterious mutation. For both genes, there were strong dose-response effects for decreasing age at onset of BRCA (or ovarian cancer) and also for increasing numbers of affected relatives. The details of the parameter estimates are provided in table 2 for the large European sample set; those for the other two ethnic classifications were broadly similar. The ethnicity- and gene-specific logistic-regression equations were then applied to a total of 3,951 family and personal histories of tested probands found to carry a VUS, to obtain log-ORs as described in the â€œMethodsâ€� section. The average number of such scores per variant was 2.76, with a range of 1â€“77; over half of the studied variants had only a single family history available for study. One hundred eighty-two distinct variants had 5 or more family-history scores; of these, 72 had at least 10 family-history scores. The associated log-odds of causality per variant ranged from âˆ’10.6 to 11.2, with a mean of âˆ’0.26. Sixteen variants had total family history log10-likelihoodâ€“ratio (LLR) scores &amp;gt;2, whereas 55 VUSs had scores &amp;lt;âˆ’2, indicating odds of 100:1 for and against the variant being deleterious, respectively, on the basis of the family-history analysis alone.In total, 351 pedigrees of probands with 127 (45 BRCA1; 82 BRCA2) distinct variants were analyzed for cosegregation with disease in families. Odds based on the pedigree data alone ranged from 138:1 in favor of causality based on six pedigrees to &amp;gt;250,000:1 against causality based on analysis of 17 pedigrees. It should be noted that the variants targeted for this analysis were selected on the basis of prior evidence that such analysis could contribute to the likelihood calculation. In the co-occurrence analysis, 121 variants were observed at least once in trans with a known deleterious mutation, and 21 were observed two or more times. The LLRs for this source of information ranged from &amp;lt;âˆ’8 (for the variant BRCA1*N723D seen 82 times, of which 4 were in trans with a deleterious mutation) to 1.1 (BRCA1*A1708E, seen 76 times, never with a deleterious mutation). The combined evidence from all three sources ranged from odds of &amp;gt;1011:1 in favor of disease causality to 1012:1 against causality.Figure 1 contains the frequency distribution by gene of the combined log-odds of causality for the 1,433 VUSs. From this figure, we see that, whereas 133 variants could be classified as neutral with odds of &amp;gt;100:1, only 24 variants (18 BRCA1; 6 BRCA2) achieved this level of classification in favor of causality. The vast majority of variants analyzed are relatively uninformative and do not individually provide information ( fig. 1). Figure 2 displays the distribution of the log-odds of causality for missense and IFDIs as a function of whether they are located in the BRCT domain of BRCA1 or the DNA-binding domain of BRCA2. Although 27 of the 30 variants with odds in favor of causality &amp;gt;10:1 are in one of these two domains, it should be noted that 29 variants within these domains have odds in favor of neutrality of &amp;gt;100:1.Frequency histogram of combined LLR for 1,433 sequence VUSs, by gene (BRCA1 or ...Figure 1.

Yes = within DBD/BRCT; no = located outside these domains.Figure optionsTable 3 displays the list of all 43 variants with odds in favor of the VUS being deleterious of at least 20:1, showing each component of the total score and information on species conservation. Table 4 lists the odds for the 133 variants that have odds of &amp;gt;100:1 against causality and thus are likely to be of no or little clinical significance on the basis of our observations. For those variants with both family history and cosegregation information, there was a modest but significant correlation between the log-odds scores for these two sources (r=0.32; P&amp;lt;.001).Table 3.BRCA Sequence VUSs with Odds of â©¾20:1 in Favor of CausalityLLRGene and Variant\tFamily-History LLR\tCo-Occurrence\tCosegregation\tCombined LLR\tOdds in Favor of

However, there was significant heterogeneity among the three classes of sequence variant (missense/IFDI, splice, and other) (Ï‡2 2 df=109.7; P&amp;lt;.0001); 100% of splice-site mutations were estimated to be deleterious, compared with 12% of missense/IFDI mutations and 26% of other unclassified sequence variants. As in the overall set, no significant differences in the fraction of MVs estimated to be deleterious were observed between BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants. A strong association with the position of the mutation was observed with 35% (95% CI 26%â€“45%) of mutations within BRCT or DBD domains estimated to be deleterious, compared with 0% of mutations outside these domains (Ï‡2 1 df=56.3; P&amp;lt;.0001). There was no significant difference in the estimated proportion of deleterious mutations in the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain (33%) and the BRCA1 BRCT domain (37%). When mutations were classified by conservation among species, 46% (95% CI 32%â€“60%) of the conserved variants were classified as deleterious, compared with 3% of the nonconserved substitutions (Ï‡2 1 df=59.7; P&amp;lt;.0001). However, here, we did observe marginally statistically significant evidence that a higher proportion of BRCA1 missense substitutions occurring at strongly conserved positions were deleterious compared with those of BRCA2 (64% vs. 35%; P=.013).DiscussionUsing an approach based on three conditionally independent sources of information contained in the Myriad Genetic Laboratories large BRCA testing data set, we evaluated 1,433 sequence variants of unknown clinical significance in the BRCA susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Through this analysis, we were able to classify 93 variants with a threshold of odds of 1,000:1, 157 at 100:1, and 222 with odds of at least 20:1. In each case, the majority (e.g., 133 of 157 for 100:1 threshold) of VUSs classified were found to be of no clinical significance with respect to cancer risk. Although additional BRCA testing data produced by Myriad Genetic Laboratories, as well as similar data potentially available from other testing laboratories, primarily in Europe, could classify additional variants with use of this approach, it is clear that the majority of variants are unlikely to be classified in this manner, which highlights the need for use of other data. However, it should be noted that, because the variants most likely to be classified using our approach are generally the ones with many observations, the number of families who could benefit from our results is relatively large. On the basis of the Myriad database alone and with the assumption of a threshold for causality of 1,000:1 and for neutrality of 100:1, as proposed in Goldgar et al., 3 1,569 probands and their families may now have a more informative test result. Although only 140 of these are associated with a variant classified as a deleterious mutation that can be used in genetics counseling of their families, there is some benefit for the rest in knowing that they are unlikely to carry a clinically significant mutation and that their risk is that conferred by their family history alone.We emphasize that all the methods used in this article are based on the assumption that these variants are either neutral with respect to cancer risks or that they have the same age- and site-specific risks as the average BRCA mutation as estimated by Antoniou et al. 30 If a particular variant were associated with lower penetrance (but still elevated over noncarrier rates), it might provide inconclusive evidence, even given a large amount of available data, and/or there would be conflicts between the different sources of evidence (as well as other such as functional or in silico studies).Although most of the information for classification in this study is derived from the family-history analysis, in several instances, the three sources were needed to achieve a clinically useful threshold. For example, the BRCA1 variant I1766S (see table 3) shows odds in favor of causality of 13:1 from analysis of five family histories, 7.4:1 from cosegregation analysis of a single pedigree, and 1.44:1 on the basis of its observation seven times, never with a deleterious mutation, yielding overall odds of 139:1 in favor of this variant being deleterious compared with neutral. In contrast, the intronic variant BRCA1*IVS19-12Gâ†’A shows convincing odds based on six family histories (&amp;gt;30,000:1), but this conflicts with the pedigree cosegregation data (odds of 115:1 against, on the basis of three pedigrees); the overall combined evidence for this variant is 363:1, similar to that for I1766S. The reasons for this anomaly are unclear. It might reflect an unusual structure of families from the population from which this variant derives, or it might reflect some unusual pattern of risks associated with the mutation that are not well handled by these methods. To resolve this discrepancy, it would be helpful to verify the pedigree data and cancer diagnoses from the original provider/genetics counselor. Additionally, although there are no data from sequence homology to help in this analysis, in vitro tests of splicing might also provide data on the pathogenicity of this variant. Of the different approaches, we regard the cosegregation analysis as the most robust, since it relates directly to the disease risk and requires few assumptions. Unfortunately, relatively few variants can be classified by this approach alone. Our results demonstrate that the family-history classification can be very powerful, but it is more susceptible to bias due to population-specific ascertainment, 8 although this bias may be minimized by appropriate stratification into subgroups with different mutation prevalences. This highlights the need for some caution in the use of these predictions, especially when there are discrepancies between the methods.Of the 1,433 variants examined, the overall estimate of the proportion of those that are deleterious was 20%, indicating that perhaps as many as 286 of these variants could be deleterious mutations. As expected, there was good evidence that variants predicted to disrupt consensus splice donors were, as a group, deleterious; in fact, the estimated proportion of deleterious mutations was 1.0, so that there was no evidence of neutral variants under the selection criteria we used. This group accounted for an estimated 30% of all deleterious variants examined in the series. Among variants that resulted in a predicted altered BRCA protein, it was estimated that 12% were deleterious, and our analyses indicated that most (if not all) deleterious variants in this group fall at strongly conserved residues and/or in the recognized domains encompassing the BRCT repeats in BRCA1 and the DNA-binding domain in BRCA2. Note that mutations in the ring-finger domain of BRCA1 have been classified elsewhere as deleterious and thus are not included in this analysis. As a group, almost half of all missense substitutions (and IFDIs) falling at positions that were invariant in our alignments of vertebrate BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequences were estimated to be deleterious; these variants, representing 218 of the 1,433 variants studied, would require odds of causality of 117:1 to have a posterior probability of 0.99 of being deleterious. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that VUSs in nonconserved residues or variants in other parts of the proteins are deleterious, the upper confidence limits for these groups indicate that it is unlikely that there are very many of these, and substantial evidence would be required to achieve a posterior probability of 0.99 for these variants. Although there was some slight evidence that the group of missense substitutions falling at variable residues includes deleterious substitutions, these were typically cases where the cross-species sequence variation was conservative and the substitution falls well outside the evolutionarily tolerated range of variation. Further, if only the 129 variants falling at invariant positions within the two important domains are considered, the proportion of variants that are estimated to be deleterious rises to 0.73 (0.58â€“0.86). Among the 177 variants that were located in introns but not at consensus splice sites, in potential exonic splice sites, in the 5â€² UTR, or at the extreme 3â€² ends of the coding sequence, there was some evidence that this group may harbor deleterious variants (estimated proportion 26%), with 9 variants having odds in favor of causality of &amp;gt;10:1.For the variants in this analysis, the estimated proportions in table 5 could be used as prior probabilities to estimate posterior probabilities that each variant is deleterious. On the assumption that a posterior probability of 90% would be required to classify a mutation as â€œprobably deleterious,â€� missense substitutions (prior probability 0.12) require odds of 66:1 in favor of causality to be classified. Ten variants in BRCA1 and five in BRCA2 could be classified on this basis. The data on species conservation provide a more precise classification, however. On the basis of that data, mutations at invariant residues would require only odds of âˆ¼10:1 to be classified as deleteriousâ€”12 variants in BRCA1 and 11 in BRCA2 reach this level. In contrast, mutations at variable residues would require odds of âˆ¼300:1, none of which do so.Although relatively few variants can currently be classified, these data can be combined with data from other sources to provide more-powerful discrimination. These data could include further pedigree cosegregation data, but also data on tumor histopathology, which is highly predictive of BRCA1 mutation status, 32 and data on loss of heterozygosity at the BRCA1 and BRCA2 loci. 33 ;  34 This approach has recently been used for classification of a small number of BRCA1/2 variants. 35; 36 ;  37The association with sequence conservation and mutation position that we have observed will also be useful for classification of new variants not present in this data set. Thus, these data indicate that a novel mutation identified in a high-risk family will have a substantial probability of being deleterious only if it occurs in a conserved domain. Note, however, that the â€œpriorâ€� probabilities given in table 5 refer strictly to the families and variants ascertained in this database, and their application outside this context should be undertaken with a degree of caution.Although many investigators have developed in silico approaches for classification and have used evaluation of sequence changes and some have applied functional data, all of these methods require external validation, and all have suffered from a lack of such validation. The data we generated here could serve as a useful source of validation of such approaches, through repeated sampling of each variant as neutral or deleterious on the basis of its posterior probability of causality and then use of the data to estimate parameters of sensitivity and specificity of other assays.What is the immediate clinical utility of the results from the present analyses? Clearly, variants with odds against causality of &amp;gt;1,000:1 (or even 100:1) could be considered neutral, rare polymorphisms for the purpose of genetics counseling, and the at-risk unaffected family members who carry such variants would be reassured that they are not at high risk of BRCA or ovarian cancer due to BRCA1 or BRCA2, although they could still be at increased risk on the basis of their family history alone. Those who carry 1 of the 10 variants for which the evidence achieves the threshold of 1,000:1, or perhaps the 48 (36 of which are at splice sites) with posterior probabilities &amp;gt;0.99, should logically be offered the same options as carriers of BRCA-truncating mutations. Apart from those variants that meet these thresholds, will it be useful to report intermediate categories of risk, such as â€œlikely deleteriousâ€� or â€œprobably neutral,â€� or should the current odds in favor of or against causality be reported to the provider? These questions will require consideration by specialists in risk communication and other disciplines and, as such, are beyond the scope of this study. Our goal in this effort is to eventually classify, with such information, a large number of variants as either â€œdeleteriousâ€� or â€œneutralâ€� and to incorporate the evidence behind the classification as part of the BIC database, as a centralized resource for clinicians and researchers alike. We feel that, with a systematic approach such as this, the problems of clinical interpretation and patient recommendations caused by these heretofore â€œuncertainâ€� variants can be minimized.&quot;&gt;\n",
       "                Mutation screening of the breast and ovarian cancerâ€“predisposition genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 is becoming an increasingly important part of clinical practice. Classification of rare nontruncating sequence variants in these genes is problematic, because it is not known whether these subtle changes alter function sufficiently to predispose cells to cancer development. Using data from the Myriad Genetic Laboratories database of nearly 70,000 full-sequence tests, we assessed the clinical significance of 1,433 sequence variants of unknown significance (VUSs) in the BRCA genes. Three independent measures were employed in the assessment: co-occurrence in trans of a VUS with known deleterious mutations; detailed analysis, by logistic regression, of personal and family history of cancer in VUS-carrying probands; and, in a subset of probands, an analysis of cosegregation with disease in pedigrees. For each of these factors, a likelihood ratio was computed under the hypothesis that the VUSs were equivalent to an â€œaverageâ€� deleterious mutation, compared with neutral, with respect to risk. The likelihood ratios derived from each component were combined to provide an overall assessment for each VUS. A total of 133 VUSs had odds of at least 100:1 in favor of neutrality with respect to risk, whereas 43 had odds of at least 20:1 in favor of being deleterious. VUSs with evidence in favor of causality were those that were predicted to affect splicing, fell at positions that are highly conserved among BRCA orthologs, and were more likely to be located in specific domains of the proteins. In addition to their utility for improved genetics counseling of patients and their families, the global assessment reported here will be invaluable for validation of functional assays, structural models, and in silico analyses.Sequence-based testing for BRCA1 (MIM 113705) and BRCA2(MIM 600185) mutations is now widely available through both commercial laboratories and research studies. Whereas thousands of BRCA1 and BRCA2 truncating mutations have been associated with increased risk of cancer in carriers, the contribution of other BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequence variants to cancer risk remains largely undefined. These â€œvariants of unknown significanceâ€� (VUSs) are mainly missense mutations but also include a number of intronic variants and inframe deletions and insertions (IFDIs). The open-access online Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) Database, which functions as a repository of sequence alterations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, contains &amp;gt;1,500 distinct sequence variants that are currently reported as having unknown clinical significance. To date, classification of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 VUSs as cancer predisposing or neutral has proven problematic, because it is not known whether these subtle changes alter the function of the proteins sufficiently to predispose to cancer. Determination of their disease relevance on the basis of population or family studies has also proved difficult, because most of the alleles encoding these mutations are very rare and, in some cases, population specific. Although identified in a minority (5%â€“10%) of individuals tested clinically, the number of such tests performed annually worldwide means that a large number of women (and their families) are affected by the VUS issue. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that minority ethnic populations are disproportionately affected. VUSs in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes pose significant problems, because patients and physicians do not know whether the VUSs predispose to cancer or are neutral with respect to cancer risk. As a result, carriers of VUSs and their family members cannot take advantage of the risk assessment, prevention, and therapeutic measures that are available to carriers of known deleterious truncating mutations. 1 In addition, carriers of VUSs are sometimes counseled to undergo prophylactic oophorectomy or mastectomy because of the presence of the VUS, but in the absence of any knowledge of the cancer relevance of the VUS. For these reasons, the determination of the clinical relevance of VUSs in BRCA1 and BRCA2 has become an important clinical issue. Although the focus of this article is on BRCA1 and BRCA2, similar concerns and issues are found in virtually all complex, genetically heterogeneous diseases for which genetic testing is performedâ€”for example, colon cancer associated with mutations in mismatch repair genes. 2To address the problem of defining which VUSs are deleterious/disease causing and which are neutral, various types of evidence and classification schemes have been proposed.3; 4 ;  5 These include formal assessment of the cosegregation of the variant with disease in pedigrees,6; 7 ;  8 co-occurrence of the variant in question in trans with a known deleterious mutation, 9 and a number of in silico approaches that evaluate phylogenetic conservation and severity of the amino acid substitution. 10; 11 ;  12 In studies of other genes, evolutionary sequence-conservation analysis involving protein multiple-sequence alignments have been used to show that missense variants (MVs) at highly conserved/invariant residues are more often deleterious, whereas highly variable changes are more likely neutral. 13 ;  14 For BRCA1, Abkevich et al.10 developed a predictive algorithm that combines a measure of cross-species conservation, including nonmammalian BRCA1 sequences, with a measure of the degree of chemical change in amino acids, 15 to identify 50 putative deleterious BRCA1 missense mutations.A number of VUSs have been examined, in terms of their effect on protein, with use of functional assays. Efforts in this area have focused on BRCA1 mutations in the two C-terminal BRCT domains, 16 ;  17 which assess the transcriptional activation activity of the BRCT domains with use of mammalian and yeast-based models, 18; 19 ;  20 and on the E3 ligase activity associated with the N-terminal BARD1-binding domain of BRCA1.21 Examination of BRCA2 function has focused on assays of homology-directed repair and centrosome amplification in response to ectopic expression of full-length, wild-type VUS containing BRCA2 protein.22 Recently, crystal structures of the BRCA1 BRCT and BRCA2 DNA-binding domains have been used to predict that a number of VUSs predispose to cancer, 23; 24 ;  25 but genetic evidence suggests that some of these predictions are incorrect. Although none of the approaches described above have successfully been used to classify the clinical relevance of BRCA1 or BRCA2 VUSs, a number have shown promise in this regard. The development of methods based on functional assays, crystal structure, phylogenetic and sequence analyses, and other approaches has been hampered by the absence of a large number of VUSs that have been proven to be either deleterious or neutral on the basis of direct genetic evidence that can be used in validation of these various assays.In this article, we examine the genetic evidence for or against disease causality for a large number of variants, with use of a large database of tested individuals collected by Myriad Genetic Laboratories. In addition to analysis of co-occurrence of VUSs with established deleterious mutations and the analysis of VUS cosegregation in individual pedigrees, we apply a novel analysis of personal and family cancer history, using data on &amp;gt;70,000 individuals, to assess the clinical significance of 1,433 distinct sequence variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2.MethodsSource of Data and Variants AnalyzedThe data analyzed for this article come from the large database of full-sequence testing for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, performed at Myriad Genetic Laboratories. Since our primary focus was on the analysis of personal and family history, we began with all 70,071 individuals receiving full-sequence tests as of December 2005. To avoid potential confusion over which part of the personal/family history was due to which variant, this data set was reduced by eliminating all individuals who had more than one reported sequence variant (including both VUS and pathogenic mutations), which resulted in a set of 61,270 individuals with at most a single BRCA1 or BRCA2 sequence variant. We then divided the family history data set into several ethnic groups, since we postulated that probands of different ethnic backgrounds are expected to present with different distributions of mutations and different distributions of personal and family histories of cancer. After examining the data set with use of some preliminary logistic regressions to examine heterogeneity as a function of reported ethnicity, we constructed three separate groups that had similar family-history and mutation-prevalence profiles. These groups were: (a) western European, central/eastern European, other/none specified, Native American, and Asian; (b) Ashkenazi Jewish; and (c) Latin American/Caribbean and African American. In the first group, 72% were of European ancestry, 24% did not specify an ethnicity, and 4% were reported as of Asian, Middle Eastern, or Native American origin. Individual probands who reported mixed ancestry between these broad groups (e.g., Western European and Caribbean) were not included in the final data set, leaving 60,529 individual probands for analyses of family history. Table 1 shows the distribution by ethnicity and testing results of these individuals. A total of 1,433 distinct unclassified variants in 4,623 tested probands were identified through sequencing and are the subject of this article.Table 1.Results of Full BRCA Sequence Analysis of 60,529 Tested ProbandsNo. (%) of Subjects with GenotypeEthnic Group\tWild Type\tNeutral\tVUS\tBRCA1 Deletion\tBRCA2 DeletionEuropeana\t41,899 (78.6)\t1,993 (3.7)\t3,972 (7.5)\t3,102 (5.8)\t2,334 (4.4)Ashkenazi Jewish\t3,622 (80.6)\t381 (8.5)\t258 (5.7)\t139 (3.1)\t91 (2.0)African American/Caribbean\tâ€‚1,667 (60.9)\t398 (14.5)\t393 (14.3)\t176 (6.4)\t104 (3.8)â€ƒTotal\t47,188 (78.0)\t2,772 (4.6)\t4,623 (7.6)\t3,417 (5.6)\t2,529 (4.2)aSee the text for the description of ethnicity for this group.Table optionsAs before,3 we assumed that all variants can be classified as deleterious mutations (M) or neutral variants (V). Our aim was to calculate a likelihood ratio (LR) of the formView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onfor each variant, given the available data. These ratios (or Bayes factors) can be combined with prior probabilities to obtain an absolute probability that each variant is deleterious. In this work, we first focused on the data sources that are most straightforwardly quantifiable from pedigree data: co-occurrence with known deleterious mutations, family history, and cosegregation. These three sources of data are independent, and the LR can therefore be derived by multiplying the LRs from the three components. We then used an admixture model to examine the influence of the type of mutation.Co-Occurrence with Known Deleterious MutationsTo include information on the co-occurrence of a VUS in trans phase with a deleterious mutation as evidence against the variant being disease causing, we followed the likelihood-ratio calculation described in our previous work. 3 We assumed that, for BRCA1, compound heterozygotes for two deleterious mutations are vanishingly rare (occur in the testing population with a frequency of 1 in 10,000), given both biological and genetic evidence that homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for deleterious BRCA1 mutations are embryonically lethal, 26 ;  27 whereas, for BRCA2, we assumed that the probability is 1 in 1,000, the increased frequency reflecting the fact that viable compound heterozygotes have been reported as Fanconi anemia, type D1. 28 ;  29 For these analyses, we used an updated data set based on âˆ¼100,000 tests with observed frequencies of BRCA1 and BRCA2 deleterious mutations of 6.6% and 5.0%, respectively. The phase of the VUS with an observed deleterious mutation was determined through examination of haplotypes of common polymorphisms known in other examples of each variant or when the VUS and the deleterious mutation were in the same PCR fragment, as determined by direct examination of the sequence traces. In some cases, phase could not be determined, and we assumed that the first deleterious mutation was in cis phase and that subsequent different deleterious mutations were in trans phase. The LR for deleterious versus neutral is expressed asView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onwhere n is the total number of times the variant was observed, k is the number of those that were in trans with a known deleterious mutation, p1 is the overall frequency of pathogenic mutations in the data set, and p2 is the probability of being a compound heterozygote for two pathogenic mutations (e.g., p1=0.066 and p2=1/10,000).Of the 1,433 VUSs studied here, 476 were observed at least five times, and 248 had at least 10 occurrences. Of the 1,433 variants, 44 were observed to occur with at least one deleterious mutation.Classification by Personal and Family History of Tested ProbandsWe developed likelihood models on the basis of family history,3 which, given the availability of the large Myriad Genetic Laboratories data set, is an extremely powerful tool for classification of VUSs. The method is based on the difference in personal and family-history profiles between individuals found to carry a true deleterious mutation and those with a wild-type BRCA sequence. The rationale is that mutation prevalence is known to be strongly dependent on certain key factors (e.g., disease status of the proband, age at diagnosis, and number and age of relatives with breast cancer [BRCA] or ovarian cancer), so these characteristics should also predict the probability of a new disease-causing missense mutation, whereas that of a neutral mutation should be independent of family history.We suppose that we have a set of probands drawn from a population with a certain distribution of family history. Suppose first that family history is classified into n types. Let pj be the probability that an individual with a mutation has family history type j, whereas qj is the corresponding probability for neutral variants. For a VUS that is deleterious, the predicted distribution of family history should be the same as that for known pathogenic mutations. The LR for a VUS with family history in category j drawn from the same population is thereforeView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onwhere {FH} is the set of all family histories in the study population. In theory, the probabilities pj and qj could be calculated from the proportions of individuals with each category of family history who are found to carry a deleterious mutation. In practice, however, there are large numbers of possible constellations of family history, and the numbers of mutations in some categories would be very small. Instead, we estimated these probabilities by fitting a logistic-regression model. Thus, we fitted a model in which the outcome was the occurrence of a deleterious mutation versus a normal sequence, and summaries of personal and family history were included as covariates.This model then provides predicted probabilities rk that individual k is a mutation carrier, given his or her FH, isrk=P(M|{FH}k)â€‰â€Šâ€Š.Turn MathJax onLet r0 be the corresponding probability under the null hypothesis that the mutation is unrelated to family history or, equivalently, the prior probability of a deleterious mutation in the population. This is estimated by the overall proportion of individuals who have a deleterious mutation (rather than a normal sequence). For example, with use of the data in table 1, for the European group for BRCA1,View the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onThenView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onandView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onTherefore, the required LR isView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onthat is, the odds ratio (OR) of the predicted probability that the individual with the given family history is a mutation carrier against the corresponding probability under the null hypothesis. Where there are multiple individuals with the same VUS, the LRs can be multiplied. We note that this formulation implicitly assumes that all pathogenic mutations in the same gene confer identical risksâ€”that is, that there is no allelic heterogeneity.To implement this analysis, the logistic-regression model was fitted separately for each ethnic group and separately for BRCA1 and BRCA2. To construct a predictive model to be applied to the VUS probands, we used a logistic-regression model within each ethnic group, comparing the personal and family histories of individuals with known deleterious sequences versus those with normal sequences. The specific factors used in the prediction were categorized asPersonal history of tested individualBRCA1.â€‚None,2.â€‚Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) only, orDiagnosis of BRCA at age3.â€‚â©¾60,4.â€‚50â€“59,5.â€‚40â€“49,6.â€‚30â€“39, or7.â€‚&amp;lt;30.Ovarian cancer1.â€‚None orDiagnosis of ovarian cancer at age2.â€‚â©¾60,3.â€‚50â€“59,4.â€‚40â€“49, or5.â€‚&amp;lt;40.Male BRCA1.â€‚Yes or2.â€‚No.Bilateral BRCA1.â€‚Yes or2.â€‚No.andReported family history of tested proband (assessed as twice the number of first-degree relatives with given cancer type plus the number of second-degree relatives with given cancer type) (table 2).Table 2.

The predicted probabilities pk were obtained using the â€œpredictâ€� option in STATA.As a simple validation of the process outline above, we examined the family history ORs for the known deleterious variants. Of the 1,106 distinct deleterious variants examined, 123 had odds of &amp;gt;100:1 in favor of being deleterious, 216 had odds of &amp;gt;10:1, and no known variants were excluded at this same threshold. Although we recognize that these summaries may overstate the modelâ€™s out-of-sample predictive ability, since the deleterious variants were used to construct the logistic regressions, they do provide reassurance that, in general, the method is performing as we expected. Further confirmation of this is obtained by looking at the similar calculation for 44 variants already classified as neutral and not used in either the logistic regression or in the subsequent analysis of VUSs. Of these 44 variants, 33 had odds against being deleterious of &amp;gt;100:1, and the other 11 all had odds against being deleterious of a lesser magnitude.Cosegregation of VUSs in PedigreesElsewhere, we developed a general-pedigree likelihood method for evaluating cosegregation of variants with disease in families that can be used to assess disease causality for unclassified sequence variants.6 The pedigree likelihood is evaluated under the hypothesis that the variant under consideration has the same penetrance as the â€œaverageâ€� known deleterious mutation, compared with the hypothesis that the variant segregates independent of disease in the pedigree(s) under study.As part of an effort to assess the clinical significance of VUSs, individuals found, through the full-sequence testing by Myriad Genetic Laboratories, to carry a VUS are offered free testing of additional family members on a research basis. These additional individuals can be unaffected or affected with BRCA or ovarian cancer and can be male or female. Typically, only 10% of individual probands with VUS provide such samples, and, in most cases, only one or two samples per family are obtained. The pedigree information available in the Myriad Genetic Laboratories database is somewhat descriptive in nature, and, for this reason, we used a simplified model of BRCA1/2 penetrance, with seven liability classes corresponding to (1) unaffected and aged &amp;lt;20 years (or male), (2) unaffected and aged 21â€“49 years, (3) unaffected and aged â©¾50 years, (4) affected with BRCA at age &amp;lt;50 years, (5) affected with BRCA at age â©¾50, (6) affected with ovarian cancer at age &amp;lt;50, and (7) affected with ovarian cancer at age â©¾50. For each liability class, penetrance values were taken from the 2003 study of Antoniou et al., 30 by collapsing the incidence rates across the broader categories used in that study. These pedigrees were then analyzed using a modification of the LINKAGE package,31 as described by Thompson et al.,4 to obtain the required LR.Because the analysis of cosegregation relies on the distribution of the additional genotype data in the pedigree, conditional on the pedigree (including the proband) phenotypes, it is statistically independent from the family/personal information. Similarly, the co-occurrence data is independent from the other two sources, since individuals who also have known deleterious mutations are not considered in these analyses. Thus, the three individual LRs can be multiplied to arrive at a combined LR.Evaluation of Heterogeneity by Variant ClassTo estimate the proportion of mutations in the data set that are likely to be clinically significant as a function of location, conservation, class, etc., we performed a heterogeneity analysis analogous to that routinely used in linkage analysis. Specifically, the required likelihood is given byView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onThis likelihood (in practice, the log likelihood) is then maximized over Î±, and 95% CIs were constructed by finding those values of 2ln(likelihood) that differed by &amp;lt;3.84 from the maximum value. Hypotheses regarding differences in values of Î± as a function of partitions of the total variant space are performed using likelihood-ratio tests.The 1,433 variants were subdivided into the following groups:1.â€‚Variants that changed the resulting proteinâ€”for example, MVs and IFDIs;2.â€‚Variants that were extremely likely, on the basis of studies of many genes and experimental data, to affect splicing, defined for our purposes as (a) all IVSÂ±Â½ or (b) if the last nucleotide of the exon is G and if the first five bases of the subsequent intron are not GTRAG. Note that the latter set includes some missense mutations as well as silent substitutions; mutations that were missense changes as well as splice variants were counted only in the splice variant group.3.â€‚Other variants, consisting primarily of intronic variants not located within 2 bp of the intron/exon splice junction, exonic variants likely to affect splicing but not meeting the strict definition above, and also a small number of variants in the 5â€² UTRs and truncating variants at the extreme 3â€² end of the genes.For the missense/IFDI category, we further subdivided the variants by their location within one of two recognized functional domains of the proteins: the C-terminus region containing the BRCA1 BRCT repeats, defined loosely here as â€œamino acids 1396â€“1862,â€� and the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 2500â€“3098). We also categorized these variants according to whether the wild-type residue involved in the substitution/deletion was evolutionarily conserved through the pufferfish Tetraodon, using multiple-sequence alignments constructed by S.V.T. 10 and available on the Align GVGD Web site. In the case of three inframe insertions, these were denoted as â€œconservedâ€� if the alignment across species was stable in the region surrounding the location of the insertion.Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 9.0 (StataCorp). The heterogeneity analysis was performed using the R programming language.ResultsWe first built the logistic-regression model comparing probands found with wild-type BRCA sequence with those with known deleterious mutations, using the factors detailed in the â€œ Methodsâ€� section. As might be expected with the very large sample sizes used in the analysis, the logistic regressions were highly significant with good predictive power; areas under the ROC curve were âˆ¼0.80 for BRCA1 and âˆ¼0.70 for BRCA2. Not surprisingly, the most highly significant predictive factors associated with a deleterious BRCA1 mutation were associated with personal and family history of ovarian cancer, with high ORs for early-onset BRCA as well. For BRCA2, the most important factors were a personal history of male BRCA and personal/family history of early-onset BRCA. Interestingly a strong family history of BRCA diagnosed after age 50 years was associated with an increased probability of having a BRCA2 mutation but a decreased risk of carrying a BRCA1 deleterious mutation. For both genes, there were strong dose-response effects for decreasing age at onset of BRCA (or ovarian cancer) and also for increasing numbers of affected relatives. The details of the parameter estimates are provided in table 2 for the large European sample set; those for the other two ethnic classifications were broadly similar. The ethnicity- and gene-specific logistic-regression equations were then applied to a total of 3,951 family and personal histories of tested probands found to carry a VUS, to obtain log-ORs as described in the â€œMethodsâ€� section. The average number of such scores per variant was 2.76, with a range of 1â€“77; over half of the studied variants had only a single family history available for study. One hundred eighty-two distinct variants had 5 or more family-history scores; of these, 72 had at least 10 family-history scores. The associated log-odds of causality per variant ranged from âˆ’10.6 to 11.2, with a mean of âˆ’0.26. Sixteen variants had total family history log10-likelihoodâ€“ratio (LLR) scores &amp;gt;2, whereas 55 VUSs had scores &amp;lt;âˆ’2, indicating odds of 100:1 for and against the variant being deleterious, respectively, on the basis of the family-history analysis alone.In total, 351 pedigrees of probands with 127 (45 BRCA1; 82 BRCA2) distinct variants were analyzed for cosegregation with disease in families. Odds based on the pedigree data alone ranged from 138:1 in favor of causality based on six pedigrees to &amp;gt;250,000:1 against causality based on analysis of 17 pedigrees. It should be noted that the variants targeted for this analysis were selected on the basis of prior evidence that such analysis could contribute to the likelihood calculation. In the co-occurrence analysis, 121 variants were observed at least once in trans with a known deleterious mutation, and 21 were observed two or more times. The LLRs for this source of information ranged from &amp;lt;âˆ’8 (for the variant BRCA1*N723D seen 82 times, of which 4 were in trans with a deleterious mutation) to 1.1 (BRCA1*A1708E, seen 76 times, never with a deleterious mutation). The combined evidence from all three sources ranged from odds of &amp;gt;1011:1 in favor of disease causality to 1012:1 against causality.Figure 1 contains the frequency distribution by gene of the combined log-odds of causality for the 1,433 VUSs. From this figure, we see that, whereas 133 variants could be classified as neutral with odds of &amp;gt;100:1, only 24 variants (18 BRCA1; 6 BRCA2) achieved this level of classification in favor of causality. The vast majority of variants analyzed are relatively uninformative and do not individually provide information ( fig. 1). Figure 2 displays the distribution of the log-odds of causality for missense and IFDIs as a function of whether they are located in the BRCT domain of BRCA1 or the DNA-binding domain of BRCA2. Although 27 of the 30 variants with odds in favor of causality &amp;gt;10:1 are in one of these two domains, it should be noted that 29 variants within these domains have odds in favor of neutrality of &amp;gt;100:1.Frequency histogram of combined LLR for 1,433 sequence VUSs, by gene (BRCA1 or ...Figure 1.

Table 4 lists the odds for the 133 variants that have odds of &amp;gt;100:1 against causality and thus are likely to be of no or little clinical significance on the basis of our observations. For those variants with both family history and cosegregation information, there was a modest but significant correlation between the log-odds scores for these two sources (r=0.32; P&amp;lt;.001).Table 3.BRCA Sequence VUSs with Odds of â©¾20:1 in Favor of CausalityLLRGene and Variant\tFamily-History LLR\tCo-Occurrence\tCosegregation\tCombined LLR\tOdds in Favor of

However, there was significant heterogeneity among the three classes of sequence variant (missense/IFDI, splice, and other) (Ï‡2 2 df=109.7; P&amp;lt;.0001); 100% of splice-site mutations were estimated to be deleterious, compared with 12% of missense/IFDI mutations and 26% of other unclassified sequence variants. As in the overall set, no significant differences in the fraction of MVs estimated to be deleterious were observed between BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants. A strong association with the position of the mutation was observed with 35% (95% CI 26%â€“45%) of mutations within BRCT or DBD domains estimated to be deleterious, compared with 0% of mutations outside these domains (Ï‡2 1 df=56.3; P&amp;lt;.0001). There was no significant difference in the estimated proportion of deleterious mutations in the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain (33%) and the BRCA1 BRCT domain (37%). When mutations were classified by conservation among species, 46% (95% CI 32%â€“60%) of the conserved variants were classified as deleterious, compared with 3% of the nonconserved substitutions (Ï‡2 1 df=59.7; P&amp;lt;.0001). However, here, we did observe marginally statistically significant evidence that a higher proportion of BRCA1 missense substitutions occurring at strongly conserved positions were deleterious compared with those of BRCA2 (64% vs. 35%; P=.013).DiscussionUsing an approach based on three conditionally independent sources of information contained in the Myriad Genetic Laboratories large BRCA testing data set, we evaluated 1,433 sequence variants of unknown clinical significance in the BRCA susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Through this analysis, we were able to classify 93 variants with a threshold of odds of 1,000:1, 157 at 100:1, and 222 with odds of at least 20:1. In each case, the majority (e.g., 133 of 157 for 100:1 threshold) of VUSs classified were found to be of no clinical significance with respect to cancer risk. Although additional BRCA testing data produced by Myriad Genetic Laboratories, as well as similar data potentially available from other testing laboratories, primarily in Europe, could classify additional variants with use of this approach, it is clear that the majority of variants are unlikely to be classified in this manner, which highlights the need for use of other data. However, it should be noted that, because the variants most likely to be classified using our approach are generally the ones with many observations, the number of families who could benefit from our results is relatively large. On the basis of the Myriad database alone and with the assumption of a threshold for causality of 1,000:1 and for neutrality of 100:1, as proposed in Goldgar et al., 3 1,569 probands and their families may now have a more informative test result. Although only 140 of these are associated with a variant classified as a deleterious mutation that can be used in genetics counseling of their families, there is some benefit for the rest in knowing that they are unlikely to carry a clinically significant mutation and that their risk is that conferred by their family history alone.We emphasize that all the methods used in this article are based on the assumption that these variants are either neutral with respect to cancer risks or that they have the same age- and site-specific risks as the average BRCA mutation as estimated by Antoniou et al. 30 If a particular variant were associated with lower penetrance (but still elevated over noncarrier rates), it might provide inconclusive evidence, even given a large amount of available data, and/or there would be conflicts between the different sources of evidence (as well as other such as functional or in silico studies).Although most of the information for classification in this study is derived from the family-history analysis, in several instances, the three sources were needed to achieve a clinically useful threshold. For example, the BRCA1 variant I1766S (see table 3) shows odds in favor of causality of 13:1 from analysis of five family histories, 7.4:1 from cosegregation analysis of a single pedigree, and 1.44:1 on the basis of its observation seven times, never with a deleterious mutation, yielding overall odds of 139:1 in favor of this variant being deleterious compared with neutral. In contrast, the intronic variant BRCA1*IVS19-12Gâ†’A shows convincing odds based on six family histories (&amp;gt;30,000:1), but this conflicts with the pedigree cosegregation data (odds of 115:1 against, on the basis of three pedigrees); the overall combined evidence for this variant is 363:1, similar to that for I1766S. The reasons for this anomaly are unclear. It might reflect an unusual structure of families from the population from which this variant derives, or it might reflect some unusual pattern of risks associated with the mutation that are not well handled by these methods. To resolve this discrepancy, it would be helpful to verify the pedigree data and cancer diagnoses from the original provider/genetics counselor. Additionally, although there are no data from sequence homology to help in this analysis, in vitro tests of splicing might also provide data on the pathogenicity of this variant. Of the different approaches, we regard the cosegregation analysis as the most robust, since it relates directly to the disease risk and requires few assumptions. Unfortunately, relatively few variants can be classified by this approach alone. Our results demonstrate that the family-history classification can be very powerful, but it is more susceptible to bias due to population-specific ascertainment, 8 although this bias may be minimized by appropriate stratification into subgroups with different mutation prevalences. This highlights the need for some caution in the use of these predictions, especially when there are discrepancies between the methods.Of the 1,433 variants examined, the overall estimate of the proportion of those that are deleterious was 20%, indicating that perhaps as many as 286 of these variants could be deleterious mutations. As expected, there was good evidence that variants predicted to disrupt consensus splice donors were, as a group, deleterious; in fact, the estimated proportion of deleterious mutations was 1.0, so that there was no evidence of neutral variants under the selection criteria we used. This group accounted for an estimated 30% of all deleterious variants examined in the series. Among variants that resulted in a predicted altered BRCA protein, it was estimated that 12% were deleterious, and our analyses indicated that most (if not all) deleterious variants in this group fall at strongly conserved residues and/or in the recognized domains encompassing the BRCT repeats in BRCA1 and the DNA-binding domain in BRCA2. Note that mutations in the ring-finger domain of BRCA1 have been classified elsewhere as deleterious and thus are not included in this analysis. As a group, almost half of all missense substitutions (and IFDIs) falling at positions that were invariant in our alignments of vertebrate BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequences were estimated to be deleterious; these variants, representing 218 of the 1,433 variants studied, would require odds of causality of 117:1 to have a posterior probability of 0.99 of being deleterious. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that VUSs in nonconserved residues or variants in other parts of the proteins are deleterious, the upper confidence limits for these groups indicate that it is unlikely that there are very many of these, and substantial evidence would be required to achieve a posterior probability of 0.99 for these variants. Although there was some slight evidence that the group of missense substitutions falling at variable residues includes deleterious substitutions, these were typically cases where the cross-species sequence variation was conservative and the substitution falls well outside the evolutionarily tolerated range of variation. Further, if only the 129 variants falling at invariant positions within the two important domains are considered, the proportion of variants that are estimated to be deleterious rises to 0.73 (0.58â€“0.86). Among the 177 variants that were located in introns but not at consensus splice sites, in potential exonic splice sites, in the 5â€² UTR, or at the extreme 3â€² ends of the coding sequence, there was some evidence that this group may harbor deleterious variants (estimated proportion 26%), with 9 variants having odds in favor of causality of &amp;gt;10:1.For the variants in this analysis, the estimated proportions in table 5 could be used as prior probabilities to estimate posterior probabilities that each variant is deleterious. On the assumption that a posterior probability of 90% would be required to classify a mutation as â€œprobably deleterious,â€� missense substitutions (prior probability 0.12) require odds of 66:1 in favor of causality to be classified. Ten variants in BRCA1 and five in BRCA2 could be classified on this basis. The data on species conservation provide a more precise classification, however. On the basis of that data, mutations at invariant residues would require only odds of âˆ¼10:1 to be classified as deleteriousâ€”12 variants in BRCA1 and 11 in BRCA2 reach this level. In contrast, mutations at variable residues would require odds of âˆ¼300:1, none of which do so.Although relatively few variants can currently be classified, these data can be combined with data from other sources to provide more-powerful discrimination. These data could include further pedigree cosegregation data, but also data on tumor histopathology, which is highly predictive of BRCA1 mutation status, 32 and data on loss of heterozygosity at the BRCA1 and BRCA2 loci. 33 ;  34 This approach has recently been used for classification of a small number of BRCA1/2 variants. 35; 36 ;  37The association with sequence conservation and mutation position that we have observed will also be useful for classification of new variants not present in this data set. Thus, these data indicate that a novel mutation identified in a high-risk family will have a substantial probability of being deleterious only if it occurs in a conserved domain. Note, however, that the â€œpriorâ€� probabilities given in table 5 refer strictly to the families and variants ascertained in this database, and their application outside this context should be undertaken with a degree of caution.Although many investigators have developed in silico approaches for classification and have used evaluation of sequence changes and some have applied functional data, all of these methods require external validation, and all have suffered from a lack of such validation. The data we generated here could serve as a useful source of validation of such approaches, through repeated sampling of each variant as neutral or deleterious on the basis of its posterior probability of causality and then use of the data to estimate parameters of sensitivity and specificity of other assays.What is the immediate clinical utility of the results from the present analyses? Clearly, variants with odds against causality of &amp;gt;1,000:1 (or even 100:1) could be considered neutral, rare polymorphisms for the purpose of genetics counseling, and the at-risk unaffected family members who carry such variants would be reassured that they are not at high risk of BRCA or ovarian cancer due to BRCA1 or BRCA2, although they could still be at increased risk on the basis of their family history alone. Those who carry 1 of the 10 variants for which the evidence achieves the threshold of 1,000:1, or perhaps the 48 (36 of which are at splice sites) with posterior probabilities &amp;gt;0.99, should logically be offered the same options as carriers of BRCA-truncating mutations. Apart from those variants that meet these thresholds, will it be useful to report intermediate categories of risk, such as â€œlikely deleteriousâ€� or â€œprobably neutral,â€� or should the current odds in favor of or against causality be reported to the provider? These questions will require consideration by specialists in risk communication and other disciplines and, as such, are beyond the scope of this study. Our goal in this effort is to eventually classify, with such information, a large number of variants as either â€œdeleteriousâ€� or â€œneutralâ€� and to incorporate the evidence behind the classification as part of the BIC database, as a centralized resource for clinicians and researchers alike. We feel that, with a systematic approach such as this, the problems of clinical interpretation and patient recommendations caused by these heretofore â€œuncertainâ€� variants can be minimized.\n",

Although several functional assays for BRCA1 VUSs have been described, thus far it has not been possible to conduct a high-throughput analysis in the context of the full-length protein. We have developed a relatively fast and easy cDNA-based functional assay to classify BRCA1 VUSs based on their ability to functionally complement BRCA1-defi cient mouse embryonic stem cells.

INTRODUCTION  Germline loss-of-function mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are known to result in an approximately tenfold increased lifetime risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Thus far, no other genes have been identifi ed with such a strong link to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC), and in the past decades, many women have been screened for germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 . This has resulted in the identifi cation of numerous pathogenic mutations as well as a large number of sequence variants for which the clinical relevance is not clear. In the most recent publication of the ENIGMA (Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles) group, an international consortium for the evaluation of BRCA1 or BRCA2 sequence variants, a total of 1,273 unique BRCA1 variants is mentioned ( 1 ), but this number may increase even further because of the implementation of high-throughput sequencing methods. Of the BRCA1 variants of uncertain signifi cance (VUS), 920 are nontruncating exonic mutations that may affect protein function or mRNA splicing, but for which there is not enough linkage information to indicate whether they are pathogenic. To aid genetic counseling of individuals with BRCA1/2 VUS, both genetic and functional classifi cation methods have been developed. Genetic analysis of BRCA1 or BRCA2 VUSs relies on cosegregation with disease, cooccurrence with known pathogenic mutations, and family history of cancer. These data have been integrated into computational models to calculate the likelihood that a VUS is disease-causing ( 2 ). Additional in silico analysis of the evolutionary conservation of the amino acids affected by the mutation and the predicted impact of the mutant amino acids on protein folding are also implemented in such models. Functional assays do not rely on preexisting data, but directly test the effect of BRCA1/2 VUSs on known functions of the encoded proteins ( 3 ). Although this may seem relatively straightforward, it can be diffi cult to extrapolate data from functional assays into cancer risks for patients. For instance, in most assays only part of the BRCA1 protein is analyzed. In addition, some of the more elegant assays are technically demanding and not suitable to analyze large numbers of mutations. We reasoned that a good functional assay should fulfi ll three basic requirements: (i) it should investigate the biologic effects of a BRCA1 VUS in the context of the full-length protein; (ii) it should be conducted under normal physiologic conditions in a noncancerous cell type; and (iii) it should be based on a highly standardized and reproducible protocol.  These considerations led us to develop a functional assay based on physiologic expression of full-length human BRCA1 cDNA in mouse embryonic stem cells that are genetically engineered to allow conditional deletion of endogenous Brca1 . Mutant BRCA1 cDNAs are generated using site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) and introduced in a defi ned genomic locus of mouse embryonic stem cells by recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). In this way, we have analyzed 86 BRCA1 variants for their effects on cell proliferation and drug sensitivity, including 74 clinically relevant VUSs.  RESULTS  Generation of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells Expressing BRCA1 Sequence Variants  Although BRCA1-defi cient tumor cells proliferate rapidly in situ , loss of BRCA1 in normal cells leads to a severe proliferation defect ( 4 ).

Brca1 -selectable conditional knockout (SCo) mouse embryonic stem cells ( 5 ). These cells carry one Brca1 -null allele and a selectable conditional Brca1SCo allele, which contains, in addition to loxP sites around exons 5â€“6, a split puromycin resistance marker that is activated upon Cre-mediated deletion of exons 5â€“6. They also contain a CreERT2 allele in the Rosa26 locus, which allows for controlled activation of Cre via administration of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4-OHT). Thus, BRCA1-defi cient embryonic stem cells can be easily obtained via 4-OHTâ€“induced inactivation of the Brca1SCo allele and subsequent selection for puromycin resistance ( Fig.  1 ; ref.  5 ). To allow effi cient integration of human BRCA1 variants in one specifi c genomic locus, we supplied the other Rosa26 allele with F3 and Frt recombination sites for RMCE by the site-specifi c recombinase Flp ( Fig.  1 and Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 6 ). Cells that have undergone successful RMCE can be selected because they express a truncated neomycin selection marker under control of the endogenous Rosa26 promoter, which further increases targeting effi ciency. Flpmediated recombination ensures single-copy integration of BRCA1 expression constructs at the same Rosa26 locus, thus avoiding position-effect variegation and copy numberâ€“ dependent differences in expression.  RMCE vectors were equipped with a human BRCA1 cDNA expression construct, which was modifi ed using SDM to introduce defi ned mutations in BRCA1 . The focus of our analysis was on Dutch and Belgian VUSs that were found in families with HBOC. We also included a number of variants  Figure 1. â€‚ Schematic overview of the RMCE procedure in R26 CreERT2/RMCE ; Brca1 SCo/Î” embryonic stem cells. Before the introduction of a human BRCA1 cDNA, R26 CreERT2/RMCE ; Brca1 SCo/Î” embryonic stem cells are mouse BRCA1-profi cient and sensitive to both neomycin and puromycin. Targeting of singlecopy human BRCA1 cDNA variants to the Rosa26 locus by Flp RMCE results in expression of human BRCA1 and neomycin resistance. Addition of 4-OHT leads to CreERT2-mediated deletion of mouse Brca1 exons 5 and 6, resulting in loss of mouse BRCA1 protein and concomitant expression of puromycin from the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter. This enables selection of mouse BRCA1-defi cient, human BRCA1-expressing R26 CreERT2/hBRCA1 ; Brca1Î”/Î” embryonic stem cells that can be used in functional complementation assays.

To allow validation of our functional complementation assay, we included a series of eight BRCA1 variants that are known to be deleterious or neutral according to the Breast Cancer Information Core database (BIC; http://research.nhgri .nih.gov/bic/ ; Supplementary Table S1). These controls include the well-known pathogenic BRCA1 founder mutations 185delAG and 5382insC and the neutral polymorphisms Y105C, R866C, and E1250K. The BIC designation is supported by the classifi cation according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( http://iarc.fr/ ), which includes the Align-GVGD score that indicates biophysical and evolutionary alterations ( http://agvgd.iarc.fr/ ; Supplementary Table S1; refs. 11, 12 ). Align-GVGD scores vary between C0 (likely neutral) and C65 (likely deleterious). Sequence-verifi ed constructs that contained the intended VUS, but no other BRCA1 mutations, were transfected into R26 CreERT2/RMCE;Brca1 SCo/Î” embryonic stem cells to undergo RMCE ( Fig.  2 ). Neomycin-resistant clones were pooled and RMCE was confi rmed by PCR analysis. Subsequently, protein expression of the human BRCA1 variants was analyzed by Western blot analysis with a human BRCA1-specifi c antibody ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2). Comparison with BRCA1 protein levels in embryonic stem cells expressing human BRCA1 from a bacterial artifi cial chromosome (BAC), which is known to rescue embryonic lethality of Brca1 -null mice ( 7 ,  13 ), showed that transcription of the human BRCA1 cDNA from the EF1A gene promoter results in physiologic levels of BRCA1 protein (Supplementary Fig.  S1). Most BRCA1 variants were expressed at equal levels, allowing comparison of their functional activities. A number of C-terminal BRCA1 mutants showed low levels of expression (Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary Fig. S2). Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that decreased protein expression was not caused by decreased mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig.  S3), suggesting that the low abundance of BRCA1 protein results from posttranslational events. In fact, for most of these variants, mutation-associated protein instability has already been documented in previous publications (refs. 8 , 14 , 15 ; Supplementary Table S2).  Functional Complementation Assay of BRCA1 Sequence Variants in Mouse Brca1 -Null Embryonic Stem Cells  As a fi rst functional test, we assayed the ability of BRCA1 variants to restore the proliferation defect of switched R26 CreERT2/RMCE ;Brca1 SCo/Î” embryonic stem cells ( Fig.  2 ). Expression of endogenous mouse Brca1 was shut off through overnight induction of Cre activity by 4-OHT, and 7 days  Figure 2. â€‚ Workfl ow for the functional classifi cation of BRCA1 sequence variants in Brca1 -null embryonic stem (ES) cells.

For each group of mutants tested, we included positive and negative controls consisting of embryonic stem cells containing, respectively, wild-type human BRCA1 cDNA and an empty RMCE vector. BRCA1 variants were evaluated on their ability to support growth compared with these controls (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Although we tested 28 mutations in the central domain encoded by exon 11 (aa 224â€“1366), BRCA1 variants that were unable to rescue the proliferation defect of Brca1 -null mouse embryonic stem cells to BRCA1 wild-type levels were confi ned to the conserved N- and C-terminal domains of BRCA1.  Cisplatin Sensitivity Assay for Classifi cation of BRCA1 Variants  Although the ability of BRCA1 variants to support proliferation appears to be indicative of VUS function, results were not always clear-cut (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). BRCA1 is known to be important for DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair through mechanisms that are both dependent ( 5 ) and independent ( 16 ) of its function in homologous recombination (HR). The role of BRCA1 in ICL repair is stressed by the occurrence of genetic reversion mutations restoring BRCA1 protein expression in platinum-resistant ovarian tumors in BRCA1 -mutation carriers ( 17, 18 ). We therefore decided to conduct a 96-wellâ€“based cisplatin sensitivity assay to allow a more stringent evaluation of BRCA1 VUS functionality.  Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) of cisplatin were determined using a resazurin cell viability assay, and BRCA1 variants were again classifi ed in comparison to wildtype BRCA1 and an empty RMCE vector. To obtain corrected cisplatin IC 50 values, we fi tted a log-logistic curve constrained at 1 and 0. We excluded a fi t if the residual squared error (RSE) exceeded 0.1. We then applied a Bayesian predictor to classify BRCA1 VUS as pathogenic or benign. Most variants that showed less than wild-type activity in the proliferation assay also scored as functionally impaired in the cisplatin sensitivity assay and were classifi ed as deleterious ( Table 1 ,  Table 1. â€‚ Functional classifi cation of BRCA1 VUS based on cisplatin response Variant DNA change Type of mutation a Classifi cation S4F c.11C&amp;gt;T VUS Not Clear M18T c.53T&amp;gt;C VUS Deleterious 185delAG c.68_69delAG Deleterious control Deleterious b K45Q c.133A&amp;gt;C VUS Neutral C61G c.181T&amp;gt;G Deleterious control Deleterious C64G c.190T&amp;gt;G VUS Deleterious b D67Y c.199G&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral Y105C c.314A&amp;gt;G Neutral control Neutral N132K c.396C&amp;gt;A VUS Neutral P142H c.425C&amp;gt;A VUS Neutral L147F c.441G&amp;gt;C VUS Neutral L165P c.494T&amp;gt;C VUS Neutral R170W c.508C&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral S186Y c.557C&amp;gt;A VUS Neutral V191I c.571G&amp;gt;A VUS Neutral T231M c.692C&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral D245V c.734A&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral L246V c.736T&amp;gt;G VUS Neutral V271L c.811G&amp;gt;C VUS Neutral S308A c.922A&amp;gt;G; c.923G&amp;gt;C Artifi cial h Not Clear L358R; C360R; E362H c.1073T&amp;gt;G; c.1078T&amp;gt;C; c.1084G&amp;gt;C; c.1086G&amp;gt;T Artifi cial Neutral L668F c.2002C&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral D695N c.2083G&amp;gt;A VUS Neutral P798L c.2393C&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral N810Y c.2428A&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral T826K c.2477C&amp;gt;A VUS Neutral (continued) Downloaded from cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org on May 26, 2017.

The positive and negative controls classifi ed as expected, although the known pathogenic truncation mutation 5382insC scored as neutral in one of three assays, stressing the need for repeat experiments. Also BRCA1 variants that were previously tested in other assays conducted as expected. It should be noted that the artifi cial variants S308A and S1497A rescued proliferation and cisplatin responses of mouse Brca1 - defi cient embryonic stem cells in BAC complementation assays, but are predicted to be deleterious based on their effects on embryonic stem cell differentiation and their response to Î³-irradiation, respectively ( 7 ). The V1804D mutation scored as a neutral variant in our assay, which is in line with most published data ( 8, 9 ), except for the results of an embryonic stem cellâ€“based BAC complementation assay ( 7 ). Again, all BRCA1 mutations that were classifi ed as deleterious were confi ned to regions encoding the conserved N- and C-terminal domains ( Fig.  4 ), despite the observation that deletion of the central region encoded by exon 11 leads to genetic instability in mice ( 12 ). Remarkably, the three mutations that diminish the interaction between BRCA1 and PALB2 ( 10 ), just C-terminal of the region encoded by exon 11, had no effect on cisplatin sensitivity in this assay. Of note, there was in general good correlation between our classifi cation and the Align-GVGD score (Supplementary Table S4). Notable exceptions were the neutral control variant R866C, which validated our assay but scored as likely deleterious (C65) using Align-GVGD, and G1770V, which scored as likely neutral (C0) by Align-GVGD but was classi- fi ed as deleterious in our assay. Our assay also classifi ed some variants for which the Align-GVGD scores were less clear, emphasizing the usefulness of functional assays to complement in silico analysis.  We also analyzed the possible effects of all BRCA1 variants on mRNA splicing, which may have deleterious consequences but cannot be assessed in our cDNA-based assay. The predictive value for exonic variants outside the consensus splice sites is questionable ( 19, 20 ), but four missense mutations were present in existing splice sites (Supplementary Table S4). Although c.5154G&amp;gt;T (encoding W1718C) was deleterious, three of these variants were classifi ed as neutral in our assay. One of them, c.441G&amp;gt;C (encoding L147F), had an increased probability to damage the splice donor site of exon 7. Another variant, c.5072C&amp;gt;T (encoding T1691I), might also affect splicing, but no defect was measured in blood samples of mutation carriers ( 19 ). The third exonic splice site mutation that was classifi ed as neutral in our cisplatin sensitivity assay, c.133A&amp;gt;C (K45Q), is not predicted to lead to aberrant splicing.  Results from Proliferation and Cisplatin Sensitivity Assays Correlate with HR Activity of BRCA1 Variants  BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in DNA repair via HR ( 12 , 21 ). Together with non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), HR forms the cellular defense against DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), a severe type of DNA damage that is lethal if unrepaired. Although HR is essentially error-free, NHEJ is error-prone, and therefore defects in HR are known to lead to genomic instability.

Therefore, we used the direct repeat (DR)-GFP assay ( 27 ) to measure the effects on HR for a subset of our BRCA1 VUSs. A number of predicted pathogenic variants and controls were shuttled into R26 CreERT2/RMCE;Brca1 SCo/Î” ;Pim1 DR-GFP/wt embryonic stem cells carrying the DR-GFP reporter in the Pim1 locus. Expression of endogenous mouse Brca1 was switched off, and cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the I-SceI meganuclease as well as an mCherry fl uorescent marker to control for transfection effi ciency. Repair of I-SceIâ€“induced DNA DSBs in DR-GFP via HR leads to expression of GFP, which can be monitored by fl ow cytometry. All but one of the predicted pathogenic variants tested resulted in defective HR, thereby confi rming our functional classifi cation ( Fig. 5 ). The only predicted deleterious variant that did not signifi cantly differ from wild-type BRCA1 , R1699Q, seemed to support intermediate levels of HR activity.

It is known that BRCA1- and BRCA2- defi cient cells are extremely sensitive to PARP1 inhibition ( 28, 29 ), leading to a larger dynamic range between BRCA2- defi cient cells and isogenic BRCA2-profi cient controls than for cisplatin ( 30 ). We therefore tested complementation of PARP inhibitor sensitivity for a number of BRCA1 mutants and the BRCA1 wild-type control. Given the unexpected neutral effects of the M1400V, L1407P, and M1411T mutations in the PALB2 interaction domain, we decided to include these variants in this series, as well as the R1699Q and V1736A variants that have recently been shown to confer (intermediate) breast and ovarian cancer risk ( 31, 32 ). To allow direct comparison of results from different assays, we repeated the cisplatin sensitivity and proliferation assays in parallel to the olaparib sensitivity assay. Our results indicate that BRCA1 wild-type and empty vector controls indeed show a larger difference in sensitivity for olaparib than for cisplatin ( Fig.  6 ). However, this increase in dynamic range is accompanied by an increased variation between repeat experiments for BRCA1-profi cient samples. Nevertheless, the functional defect of the R1699Q and V1736A mutations becomes more evident, and there also Downloaded from cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org on May 26, 2017.

In the concurrent proliferation analysis, R1699Q and V1736A both show an intermediate functional defect (Supplementary Fig.  S4). Also the M1411T mutation seems to affect the response to PARP inhibition, but the difference with BRCA1 wild-type is not signifi cant. Interestingly, the L1407P and M1411T variants have previously been shown to be more defective than M1400V in a gene conversion assay ( 10 ). It should also be noted that, in contrast with the large-scale classifi cation experiments, the cisplatin sensitivity assay conducted in parallel to the PARP inhibitor assay identifi ed signifi cant functional defects for L1407P and V1736A.  DISCUSSION  Over the past few years several functional assays for classifi cation of BRCA1 VUSs have been developed. Several of these assays are restricted to functions of the BRCA1 protein that reside in the evolutionarily conserved RING or BRCT domains. Examples include in vitro transactivation assays for BRCT peptides ( 8 ) and measurement of ubiquitin ligase activity for protein fragments encompassing the N-terminal RING domain ( 33 ). Other assays were designed to evaluate the functions of full-length mutant BRCA1 protein, either by monitoring general effects on proliferation or response to DNA damage ( 7 ), or by directly focusing on the role of BRCA1 in DNA repair via HR ( 34 ).  Because BRCA1 VUSs are not restricted to regions encoding the N- or C-terminal domains, and given the observation that interaction between these domains is required for recruitment of BRCA1 to damaged DNA ( 35 ), functional assays for the full-length protein would be ideal. In principle, such assays can be conducted in cell lines derived from BRCA1 - mutated tumors, but there are indications that the outcome of assays for BRCA1 function depends on the cellular context. As absence of BRCA1 leads to loss of cellular viability, it is thought that additional mutations are required for BRCA1- associated tumorigenesis. For example, loss of p53 alleviates the consequences of BRCA1 defi ciency both in vitro and in vivo ( 4 ) and is common in BRCA1-defi cient tumors ( 36, 37 ). Also, depletion of 53BP1 is known to suppress the defects caused by BRCA1 defi ciency ( 5 , 38 , 39 ). Therefore, aberrations in BRCA1-defi cient tumor cells may mask functional defects of BRCA1 VUSs. We reasoned that assays in normal cells that can be depleted from endogenous BRCA1 expression are most likely to reveal functional defects of BRCA1 VUSs. The usefulness of this approach has been previously shown by Downloaded from cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org on May 26, 2017. Â© 2013 American Association for Cancer Research.

BAC complementation assays in mouse embryonic stem cells ( 7 , 40 ). However, mutagenesis of large BAC clones by recombineering and functional complementation of cells with these mutant constructs is time-consuming and technically demanding, and therefore cannot be conducted in a high-throughput setting. We therefore set out to develop a cDNA-based functional complementation assay in mouse embryonic stem cells that is easier to control and scale up and more suitable for routine functional classifi cation of BRCA1 sequence variants.  One advantage of BAC transgenics in complementation assays is that genes are expressed at physiologically relevant levels. This is the result of low copy-number integrations and the presence of natural regulatory elements required for proper gene expression. We decided to use RMCE to allow single-copy integration of BRCA1 cDNAs at one specifi c genomic locus. The use of RMCE effectively prevents multiple or partial integrations, concatemers, and position-effect variegation. As a result, all variants are expressed at equal levels. Moreover, transcription of BRCA1 cDNAs from the EF1A gene promoter results in physiologic levels of BRCA1 protein, comparable with those observed in embryonic stem cells stably transfected with a BAC containing the human BRCA1 locus. Indeed, the wild-type human BRCA1 cDNA was able to complement Brca1 -null embryonic stem cells in cellular proliferation, drug sensitivity, and HR assays. Our RMCE strategy uses BRCA1 cDNA constructs in which mutations can be swiftly introduced using SDM, enabling a higher throughput than introduction of mutations via BAC recombineering. In addition, the introduction of BRCA1 cDNAs via RMCE obviates the need to analyze multiple embryonic stem cell clones for correct integration and expression.  As a proof of principle, we used our functional complementation assay to analyze exonic BRCA1 VUSs that were identifi ed in families with HBOC in the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as a set of previously analyzed BRCA1 variants. A number of mutations resulted in reduced BRCA1 protein levels, most likely because of structural destabilization. In all cases, this led to diminished capacity for functional complementation. Also, several variants that gave rise to normal BRCA1 protein levels were unable to rescue the proliferation defect and cisplatin sensitivity of Brca1 -null embryonic stem cells. As BRCA1 loss of function mutations are associated with increased cancer risk, variants that score as functionally impaired in our embryonic stem cell assay system may be causally involved in tumor formation. This notion is supported by the fact that seven of eight known pathogenic or neutral control variants in our validation series were correctly classifi ed by the cisplatin sensitivity assay. The pathogenic 5382insC truncation mutation could not be classifi ed because it scored as neutral in one of three transfection series. This was probably due to technical reasons, as the 5382insC mutation did not restore HR activity in Brca1 -defi cient embryonic stem cells, in contrast with R1699Q, which was recently shown to confer intermediate risk of HBOC ( 32 ).  Our assay system yielded ambivalent results for nine other variants: S4F, S308A, S1651P, S1651F, T1691I, V1736A, E1735K, H1746Q, and R1753T. T1691I and E1735K were classifi ed as functionally impaired in only one cisplatin sensitivity test, whereas values from repeat experiments could not be taken into account because of RSE values above 0.1. S4F, S1651P, S1651F, V1736A, H1746Q, and R1753T were differently classifi ed in repeat experiments, which may refl ect technical fl aws or intermediate activity of these variants. Of note, the V1736A mutation was recently identifi ed as a pathogenic variant with hypomorphic activity in DNA repair ( 31 ). Although we did not measure signifi cant HR activity of V1736A in a DR-GFP gene conversion assay, intermediate activity of this variant is supported by the results of the proliferation assays and additional cisplatin sensitivity assays. S1651F showed HR activity similar to wild-type BRCA1 , whereas R1753T was HR-defi cient. S308A is an artifi cial mutation of a BRCA1 phosphorylation site that was able to support proliferation and resistance to DNA damage in an embryonic stem cell-based BAC complementation assay. However, S308A-complemented embryonic stem cells did show increased apoptosis when cultured in embryoid bodies ( 7 ), indicating a partial defect that might explain the ambivalent results for this mutation in our assays.  Our results show that BRCA1 variants should ideally be assayed in triplicate to avoid misclassifi cation. This also applies to BRCA1 VUS that we classifi ed as neutral, most of which were tested only once because in our current study we focused on variants that showed functional impairment. The striking restriction of unambiguously predicted pathogenic mutants to the terminal RING and BRCT domains suggests that some plasticity is allowed for the central domain of BRCA1. However, our dataset is still limited and more experiments are required to gain insight into the function of this domain.  Our cDNA-based system allows for several additional functional assays that have been described previously for BAC transgenic embryonic stem cells ( 7 ). These include assays for defects during in vitro and in vivo embryonic stem cell differentiation but also treatments with other cytotoxic agents. As a proof of principle, we investigated the activity of a number of mutants in the response to the PARP inhibitor olaparib. These included M1400V, L1407, and M1411T, which were previously shown to impair PALB2 binding and have a negative effect on BRCA1 function ( 10 ). Although the differences in sensitivity of BRCA1-defi cient versus BRCA1-profi cient embryonic stem cells are larger for olaparib than for cisplatin, increased variation between repeat experiments allowed us to identify functional defects only for L1407 and not for the other two variants in the PALB2 interaction domain, M1400V and M1411T. However, the R1699Q and V1736A variants, which are known to have hypomorphic activity, clearly showed a defect in the response to olaparib. Interestingly, both mutations are in the BRCT domain, and it has recently been shown that mutation of this domain especially confers sensitivity to PARP inhibition ( 41 ). Together, our results show that PARP inhibitor sensitivity assays may have added value, especially for the classifi cation of BRCA1 VUSs with intermediate phenotypes.  Platinum drugs and PARP inhibitors are selectively toxic to BRCA1-defi cient cells because they target HR defi ciency. Although the role of BRCA1 in HR is thought to be essential for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing accumulation of (oncogenic) mutations, other activities may also contribute to its tumor suppression function. These activities Downloaded from cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org on May 26, 2017. Â© 2013 American Association for Cancer Research.

Nevertheless, we observed a good correlation between the results of the cisplatin sensitivity assay and the results of the DR-GFP HR assay. All BRCA1 variants that failed to restore the cisplatin response in Brca1 -null embryonic stem cells were also defective in catalyzing gene conversion, thereby confi rming our functional classifi cation. It will be interesting to see if this holds true for all BRCA1 variants or whether there are also pathogenic mutations that have no effect on HR.  As with any other in vitro approach, our functional complementation assay system might still fail to identify all pathogenic variants because it does not necessarily recapitulate all aspects of BRCA1 function in vivo . A limitation of our cDNA-based assay is also that it cannot be used to investigate effects on mRNA splicing. Although algorithms have been designed to predict possible splice defects, the consequences of mutations outside of the consensus splice sites especially require functional validation experiments. For this purpose, BAC complementation assays ( 7 ), minigene-based splicing assays, or BRCA1 transcript analysis of patient blood samples ( 19 ) may be instrumental. However, transacting factors also affect splicing, and these may be tissue specifi c ( 42 ). A possible solution would be to determine the presence of BRCA1 splice variants in tumor tissue from BRCA1 VUS carriers and use this information to generate a cDNA construct for analysis of the functional consequences. To evaluate BRCA1 VUSs, there remains a need for multifactorial models that combine results from functional assays and in silico analyses with genetic evidence and other information from mutation carriers. This also includes DNA copy number data from tumors from BRCA1 VUS carriers, as it is known that BRCA1- associated breast tumors show distinct genomic aberrations ( 43, 44 ). Our functional assay system does however provide a robust and easily implementable tool for the functional characterization of large numbers of BRCA1 VUSs within the context of the full-length protein. It is our hope that our assay system will fi nd its way to clinical genetics laboratories where it can be used to aid genetic counseling. Ideally, these tests should be coordinated on an international level and in close collaboration with the ENIGMA consortium.&quot;&gt;\n",
       "                Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for the majority of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, and therefore sequence analysis of both genes is routinely conducted in patients with early-onset breast cancer. Besides mutations that clearly abolish protein function or are known to increase cancer risk, a large number of sequence variants of uncertain signifi cance (VUS) have been identifi ed. Although several functional assays for BRCA1 VUSs have been described, thus far it has not been possible to conduct a high-throughput analysis in the context of the full-length protein. We have developed a relatively fast and easy cDNA-based functional assay to classify BRCA1 VUSs based on their ability to functionally complement BRCA1-defi cient mouse embryonic stem cells. Using this assay, we have analyzed 74 unclassifi ed BRCA1 missense mutants for which all predicted pathogenic variants are confi ned to the BRCA1 RING and BRCT domains.  SIGNIFICANCE: BRCA1 VUSs are frequently found in patients with hereditary breast or ovarian cancer and present a serious problem for clinical geneticists. This article describes the generation, validation, and application of a reliable high-throughput assay for the functional classifi cation of BRCA1 sequence variants of uncertain signifi cance.

INTRODUCTION  Germline loss-of-function mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are known to result in an approximately tenfold increased lifetime risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Thus far, no other genes have been identifi ed with such a strong link to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC), and in the past decades, many women have been screened for germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 . This has resulted in the identifi cation of numerous pathogenic mutations as well as a large number of sequence variants for which the clinical relevance is not clear. In the most recent publication of the ENIGMA (Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles) group, an international consortium for the evaluation of BRCA1 or BRCA2 sequence variants, a total of 1,273 unique BRCA1 variants is mentioned ( 1 ), but this number may increase even further because of the implementation of high-throughput sequencing methods. Of the BRCA1 variants of uncertain signifi cance (VUS), 920 are nontruncating exonic mutations that may affect protein function or mRNA splicing, but for which there is not enough linkage information to indicate whether they are pathogenic. To aid genetic counseling of individuals with BRCA1/2 VUS, both genetic and functional classifi cation methods have been developed. Genetic analysis of BRCA1 or BRCA2 VUSs relies on cosegregation with disease, cooccurrence with known pathogenic mutations, and family history of cancer. These data have been integrated into computational models to calculate the likelihood that a VUS is disease-causing ( 2 ). Additional in silico analysis of the evolutionary conservation of the amino acids affected by the mutation and the predicted impact of the mutant amino acids on protein folding are also implemented in such models. Functional assays do not rely on preexisting data, but directly test the effect of BRCA1/2 VUSs on known functions of the encoded proteins ( 3 ). Although this may seem relatively straightforward, it can be diffi cult to extrapolate data from functional assays into cancer risks for patients. For instance, in most assays only part of the BRCA1 protein is analyzed. In addition, some of the more elegant assays are technically demanding and not suitable to analyze large numbers of mutations. We reasoned that a good functional assay should fulfi ll three basic requirements: (i) it should investigate the biologic effects of a BRCA1 VUS in the context of the full-length protein; (ii) it should be conducted under normal physiologic conditions in a noncancerous cell type; and (iii) it should be based on a highly standardized and reproducible protocol.  These considerations led us to develop a functional assay based on physiologic expression of full-length human BRCA1 cDNA in mouse embryonic stem cells that are genetically engineered to allow conditional deletion of endogenous Brca1 . Mutant BRCA1 cDNAs are generated using site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) and introduced in a defi ned genomic locus of mouse embryonic stem cells by recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). In this way, we have analyzed 86 BRCA1 variants for their effects on cell proliferation and drug sensitivity, including 74 clinically relevant VUSs.  RESULTS  Generation of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells Expressing BRCA1 Sequence Variants  Although BRCA1-defi cient tumor cells proliferate rapidly in situ , loss of BRCA1 in normal cells leads to a severe proliferation defect ( 4 ).

These cells carry one Brca1 -null allele and a selectable conditional Brca1SCo allele, which contains, in addition to loxP sites around exons 5â€“6, a split puromycin resistance marker that is activated upon Cre-mediated deletion of exons 5â€“6. They also contain a CreERT2 allele in the Rosa26 locus, which allows for controlled activation of Cre via administration of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4-OHT). Thus, BRCA1-defi cient embryonic stem cells can be easily obtained via 4-OHTâ€“induced inactivation of the Brca1SCo allele and subsequent selection for puromycin resistance ( Fig.  1 ; ref.  5 ). To allow effi cient integration of human BRCA1 variants in one specifi c genomic locus, we supplied the other Rosa26 allele with F3 and Frt recombination sites for RMCE by the site-specifi c recombinase Flp ( Fig.  1 and Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 6 ). Cells that have undergone successful RMCE can be selected because they express a truncated neomycin selection marker under control of the endogenous Rosa26 promoter, which further increases targeting effi ciency. Flpmediated recombination ensures single-copy integration of BRCA1 expression constructs at the same Rosa26 locus, thus avoiding position-effect variegation and copy numberâ€“ dependent differences in expression.  RMCE vectors were equipped with a human BRCA1 cDNA expression construct, which was modifi ed using SDM to introduce defi ned mutations in BRCA1 . The focus of our analysis was on Dutch and Belgian VUSs that were found in families with HBOC. We also included a number of variants  Figure 1. â€‚ Schematic overview of the RMCE procedure in R26 CreERT2/RMCE ; Brca1 SCo/Î” embryonic stem cells. Before the introduction of a human BRCA1 cDNA, R26 CreERT2/RMCE ; Brca1 SCo/Î” embryonic stem cells are mouse BRCA1-profi cient and sensitive to both neomycin and puromycin. Targeting of singlecopy human BRCA1 cDNA variants to the Rosa26 locus by Flp RMCE results in expression of human BRCA1 and neomycin resistance. Addition of 4-OHT leads to CreERT2-mediated deletion of mouse Brca1 exons 5 and 6, resulting in loss of mouse BRCA1 protein and concomitant expression of puromycin from the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter. This enables selection of mouse BRCA1-defi cient, human BRCA1-expressing R26 CreERT2/hBRCA1 ; Brca1Î”/Î” embryonic stem cells that can be used in functional complementation assays.

To allow validation of our functional complementation assay, we included a series of eight BRCA1 variants that are known to be deleterious or neutral according to the Breast Cancer Information Core database (BIC; http://research.nhgri .nih.gov/bic/ ; Supplementary Table S1). These controls include the well-known pathogenic BRCA1 founder mutations 185delAG and 5382insC and the neutral polymorphisms Y105C, R866C, and E1250K. The BIC designation is supported by the classifi cation according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( http://iarc.fr/ ), which includes the Align-GVGD score that indicates biophysical and evolutionary alterations ( http://agvgd.iarc.fr/ ; Supplementary Table S1; refs. 11, 12 ). Align-GVGD scores vary between C0 (likely neutral) and C65 (likely deleterious). Sequence-verifi ed constructs that contained the intended VUS, but no other BRCA1 mutations, were transfected into R26 CreERT2/RMCE;Brca1 SCo/Î” embryonic stem cells to undergo RMCE ( Fig.  2 ). Neomycin-resistant clones were pooled and RMCE was confi rmed by PCR analysis. Subsequently, protein expression of the human BRCA1 variants was analyzed by Western blot analysis with a human BRCA1-specifi c antibody ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2). Comparison with BRCA1 protein levels in embryonic stem cells expressing human BRCA1 from a bacterial artifi cial chromosome (BAC), which is known to rescue embryonic lethality of Brca1 -null mice ( 7 ,  13 ), showed that transcription of the human BRCA1 cDNA from the EF1A gene promoter results in physiologic levels of BRCA1 protein (Supplementary Fig.  S1). Most BRCA1 variants were expressed at equal levels, allowing comparison of their functional activities. A number of C-terminal BRCA1 mutants showed low levels of expression (Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary Fig. S2). Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that decreased protein expression was not caused by decreased mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig.  S3), suggesting that the low abundance of BRCA1 protein results from posttranslational events. In fact, for most of these variants, mutation-associated protein instability has already been documented in previous publications (refs. 8 , 14 , 15 ; Supplementary Table S2).  Functional Complementation Assay of BRCA1 Sequence Variants in Mouse Brca1 -Null Embryonic Stem Cells  As a fi rst functional test, we assayed the ability of BRCA1 variants to restore the proliferation defect of switched R26 CreERT2/RMCE ;Brca1 SCo/Î” embryonic stem cells ( Fig.  2 ). Expression of endogenous mouse Brca1 was shut off through overnight induction of Cre activity by 4-OHT, and 7 days  Figure 2. â€‚ Workfl ow for the functional classifi cation of BRCA1 sequence variants in Brca1 -null embryonic stem (ES) cells.

For each group of mutants tested, we included positive and negative controls consisting of embryonic stem cells containing, respectively, wild-type human BRCA1 cDNA and an empty RMCE vector. BRCA1 variants were evaluated on their ability to support growth compared with these controls (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Although we tested 28 mutations in the central domain encoded by exon 11 (aa 224â€“1366), BRCA1 variants that were unable to rescue the proliferation defect of Brca1 -null mouse embryonic stem cells to BRCA1 wild-type levels were confi ned to the conserved N- and C-terminal domains of BRCA1.  Cisplatin Sensitivity Assay for Classifi cation of BRCA1 Variants  Although the ability of BRCA1 variants to support proliferation appears to be indicative of VUS function, results were not always clear-cut (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). BRCA1 is known to be important for DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair through mechanisms that are both dependent ( 5 ) and independent ( 16 ) of its function in homologous recombination (HR). The role of BRCA1 in ICL repair is stressed by the occurrence of genetic reversion mutations restoring BRCA1 protein expression in platinum-resistant ovarian tumors in BRCA1 -mutation carriers ( 17, 18 ). We therefore decided to conduct a 96-wellâ€“based cisplatin sensitivity assay to allow a more stringent evaluation of BRCA1 VUS functionality.  Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) of cisplatin were determined using a resazurin cell viability assay, and BRCA1 variants were again classifi ed in comparison to wildtype BRCA1 and an empty RMCE vector. To obtain corrected cisplatin IC 50 values, we fi tted a log-logistic curve constrained at 1 and 0. We excluded a fi t if the residual squared error (RSE) exceeded 0.1. We then applied a Bayesian predictor to classify BRCA1 VUS as pathogenic or benign. Most variants that showed less than wild-type activity in the proliferation assay also scored as functionally impaired in the cisplatin sensitivity assay and were classifi ed as deleterious ( Table 1 ,  Table 1. â€‚ Functional classifi cation of BRCA1 VUS based on cisplatin response Variant DNA change Type of mutation a Classifi cation S4F c.11C&amp;gt;T VUS Not Clear M18T c.53T&amp;gt;C VUS Deleterious 185delAG c.68_69delAG Deleterious control Deleterious b K45Q c.133A&amp;gt;C VUS Neutral C61G c.181T&amp;gt;G Deleterious control Deleterious C64G c.190T&amp;gt;G VUS Deleterious b D67Y c.199G&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral Y105C c.314A&amp;gt;G Neutral control Neutral N132K c.396C&amp;gt;A VUS Neutral P142H c.425C&amp;gt;A VUS Neutral L147F c.441G&amp;gt;C VUS Neutral L165P c.494T&amp;gt;C VUS Neutral R170W c.508C&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral S186Y c.557C&amp;gt;A VUS Neutral V191I c.571G&amp;gt;A VUS Neutral T231M c.692C&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral D245V c.734A&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral L246V c.736T&amp;gt;G VUS Neutral V271L c.811G&amp;gt;C VUS Neutral S308A c.922A&amp;gt;G; c.923G&amp;gt;C Artifi cial h Not Clear L358R; C360R; E362H c.1073T&amp;gt;G; c.1078T&amp;gt;C; c.1084G&amp;gt;C; c.1086G&amp;gt;T Artifi cial Neutral L668F c.2002C&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral D695N c.2083G&amp;gt;A VUS Neutral P798L c.2393C&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral N810Y c.2428A&amp;gt;T VUS Neutral T826K c.2477C&amp;gt;A VUS Neutral (continued) Downloaded from cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org on May 26, 2017.

Variants showing increased cisplatin sensitivity were tested at least twice before they were classifi ed. The positive and negative controls classifi ed as expected, although the known pathogenic truncation mutation 5382insC scored as neutral in one of three assays, stressing the need for repeat experiments. Also BRCA1 variants that were previously tested in other assays conducted as expected. It should be noted that the artifi cial variants S308A and S1497A rescued proliferation and cisplatin responses of mouse Brca1 - defi cient embryonic stem cells in BAC complementation assays, but are predicted to be deleterious based on their effects on embryonic stem cell differentiation and their response to Î³-irradiation, respectively ( 7 ). The V1804D mutation scored as a neutral variant in our assay, which is in line with most published data ( 8, 9 ), except for the results of an embryonic stem cellâ€“based BAC complementation assay ( 7 ). Again, all BRCA1 mutations that were classifi ed as deleterious were confi ned to regions encoding the conserved N- and C-terminal domains ( Fig.  4 ), despite the observation that deletion of the central region encoded by exon 11 leads to genetic instability in mice ( 12 ). Remarkably, the three mutations that diminish the interaction between BRCA1 and PALB2 ( 10 ), just C-terminal of the region encoded by exon 11, had no effect on cisplatin sensitivity in this assay. Of note, there was in general good correlation between our classifi cation and the Align-GVGD score (Supplementary Table S4). Notable exceptions were the neutral control variant R866C, which validated our assay but scored as likely deleterious (C65) using Align-GVGD, and G1770V, which scored as likely neutral (C0) by Align-GVGD but was classi- fi ed as deleterious in our assay. Our assay also classifi ed some variants for which the Align-GVGD scores were less clear, emphasizing the usefulness of functional assays to complement in silico analysis.  We also analyzed the possible effects of all BRCA1 variants on mRNA splicing, which may have deleterious consequences but cannot be assessed in our cDNA-based assay. The predictive value for exonic variants outside the consensus splice sites is questionable ( 19, 20 ), but four missense mutations were present in existing splice sites (Supplementary Table S4). Although c.5154G&amp;gt;T (encoding W1718C) was deleterious, three of these variants were classifi ed as neutral in our assay. One of them, c.441G&amp;gt;C (encoding L147F), had an increased probability to damage the splice donor site of exon 7. Another variant, c.5072C&amp;gt;T (encoding T1691I), might also affect splicing, but no defect was measured in blood samples of mutation carriers ( 19 ). The third exonic splice site mutation that was classifi ed as neutral in our cisplatin sensitivity assay, c.133A&amp;gt;C (K45Q), is not predicted to lead to aberrant splicing.  Results from Proliferation and Cisplatin Sensitivity Assays Correlate with HR Activity of BRCA1 Variants  BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in DNA repair via HR ( 12 , 21 ). Together with non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), HR forms the cellular defense against DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), a severe type of DNA damage that is lethal if unrepaired. Although HR is essentially error-free, NHEJ is error-prone, and therefore defects in HR are known to lead to genomic instability.

Therefore, we used the direct repeat (DR)-GFP assay ( 27 ) to measure the effects on HR for a subset of our BRCA1 VUSs. A number of predicted pathogenic variants and controls were shuttled into R26 CreERT2/RMCE;Brca1 SCo/Î” ;Pim1 DR-GFP/wt embryonic stem cells carrying the DR-GFP reporter in the Pim1 locus. Expression of endogenous mouse Brca1 was switched off, and cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the I-SceI meganuclease as well as an mCherry fl uorescent marker to control for transfection effi ciency. Repair of I-SceIâ€“induced DNA DSBs in DR-GFP via HR leads to expression of GFP, which can be monitored by fl ow cytometry. All but one of the predicted pathogenic variants tested resulted in defective HR, thereby confi rming our functional classifi cation ( Fig. 5 ). The only predicted deleterious variant that did not signifi cantly differ from wild-type BRCA1 , R1699Q, seemed to support intermediate levels of HR activity.

It is known that BRCA1- and BRCA2- defi cient cells are extremely sensitive to PARP1 inhibition ( 28, 29 ), leading to a larger dynamic range between BRCA2- defi cient cells and isogenic BRCA2-profi cient controls than for cisplatin ( 30 ). We therefore tested complementation of PARP inhibitor sensitivity for a number of BRCA1 mutants and the BRCA1 wild-type control. Given the unexpected neutral effects of the M1400V, L1407P, and M1411T mutations in the PALB2 interaction domain, we decided to include these variants in this series, as well as the R1699Q and V1736A variants that have recently been shown to confer (intermediate) breast and ovarian cancer risk ( 31, 32 ). To allow direct comparison of results from different assays, we repeated the cisplatin sensitivity and proliferation assays in parallel to the olaparib sensitivity assay. Our results indicate that BRCA1 wild-type and empty vector controls indeed show a larger difference in sensitivity for olaparib than for cisplatin ( Fig.  6 ). However, this increase in dynamic range is accompanied by an increased variation between repeat experiments for BRCA1-profi cient samples. Nevertheless, the functional defect of the R1699Q and V1736A mutations becomes more evident, and there also Downloaded from cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org on May 26, 2017.

In the concurrent proliferation analysis, R1699Q and V1736A both show an intermediate functional defect (Supplementary Fig.  S4). Also the M1411T mutation seems to affect the response to PARP inhibition, but the difference with BRCA1 wild-type is not signifi cant. Interestingly, the L1407P and M1411T variants have previously been shown to be more defective than M1400V in a gene conversion assay ( 10 ). It should also be noted that, in contrast with the large-scale classifi cation experiments, the cisplatin sensitivity assay conducted in parallel to the PARP inhibitor assay identifi ed signifi cant functional defects for L1407P and V1736A.  DISCUSSION  Over the past few years several functional assays for classifi cation of BRCA1 VUSs have been developed. Several of these assays are restricted to functions of the BRCA1 protein that reside in the evolutionarily conserved RING or BRCT domains. Examples include in vitro transactivation assays for BRCT peptides ( 8 ) and measurement of ubiquitin ligase activity for protein fragments encompassing the N-terminal RING domain ( 33 ). Other assays were designed to evaluate the functions of full-length mutant BRCA1 protein, either by monitoring general effects on proliferation or response to DNA damage ( 7 ), or by directly focusing on the role of BRCA1 in DNA repair via HR ( 34 ).  Because BRCA1 VUSs are not restricted to regions encoding the N- or C-terminal domains, and given the observation that interaction between these domains is required for recruitment of BRCA1 to damaged DNA ( 35 ), functional assays for the full-length protein would be ideal. In principle, such assays can be conducted in cell lines derived from BRCA1 - mutated tumors, but there are indications that the outcome of assays for BRCA1 function depends on the cellular context. As absence of BRCA1 leads to loss of cellular viability, it is thought that additional mutations are required for BRCA1- associated tumorigenesis. For example, loss of p53 alleviates the consequences of BRCA1 defi ciency both in vitro and in vivo ( 4 ) and is common in BRCA1-defi cient tumors ( 36, 37 ). Also, depletion of 53BP1 is known to suppress the defects caused by BRCA1 defi ciency ( 5 , 38 , 39 ). Therefore, aberrations in BRCA1-defi cient tumor cells may mask functional defects of BRCA1 VUSs. We reasoned that assays in normal cells that can be depleted from endogenous BRCA1 expression are most likely to reveal functional defects of BRCA1 VUSs. The usefulness of this approach has been previously shown by Downloaded from cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org on May 26, 2017. Â© 2013 American Association for Cancer Research.

BAC complementation assays in mouse embryonic stem cells ( 7 , 40 ). However, mutagenesis of large BAC clones by recombineering and functional complementation of cells with these mutant constructs is time-consuming and technically demanding, and therefore cannot be conducted in a high-throughput setting. We therefore set out to develop a cDNA-based functional complementation assay in mouse embryonic stem cells that is easier to control and scale up and more suitable for routine functional classifi cation of BRCA1 sequence variants.  One advantage of BAC transgenics in complementation assays is that genes are expressed at physiologically relevant levels. This is the result of low copy-number integrations and the presence of natural regulatory elements required for proper gene expression. We decided to use RMCE to allow single-copy integration of BRCA1 cDNAs at one specifi c genomic locus. The use of RMCE effectively prevents multiple or partial integrations, concatemers, and position-effect variegation. As a result, all variants are expressed at equal levels. Moreover, transcription of BRCA1 cDNAs from the EF1A gene promoter results in physiologic levels of BRCA1 protein, comparable with those observed in embryonic stem cells stably transfected with a BAC containing the human BRCA1 locus. Indeed, the wild-type human BRCA1 cDNA was able to complement Brca1 -null embryonic stem cells in cellular proliferation, drug sensitivity, and HR assays. Our RMCE strategy uses BRCA1 cDNA constructs in which mutations can be swiftly introduced using SDM, enabling a higher throughput than introduction of mutations via BAC recombineering. In addition, the introduction of BRCA1 cDNAs via RMCE obviates the need to analyze multiple embryonic stem cell clones for correct integration and expression.  As a proof of principle, we used our functional complementation assay to analyze exonic BRCA1 VUSs that were identifi ed in families with HBOC in the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as a set of previously analyzed BRCA1 variants. A number of mutations resulted in reduced BRCA1 protein levels, most likely because of structural destabilization. In all cases, this led to diminished capacity for functional complementation. Also, several variants that gave rise to normal BRCA1 protein levels were unable to rescue the proliferation defect and cisplatin sensitivity of Brca1 -null embryonic stem cells. As BRCA1 loss of function mutations are associated with increased cancer risk, variants that score as functionally impaired in our embryonic stem cell assay system may be causally involved in tumor formation. This notion is supported by the fact that seven of eight known pathogenic or neutral control variants in our validation series were correctly classifi ed by the cisplatin sensitivity assay. The pathogenic 5382insC truncation mutation could not be classifi ed because it scored as neutral in one of three transfection series. This was probably due to technical reasons, as the 5382insC mutation did not restore HR activity in Brca1 -defi cient embryonic stem cells, in contrast with R1699Q, which was recently shown to confer intermediate risk of HBOC ( 32 ).  Our assay system yielded ambivalent results for nine other variants: S4F, S308A, S1651P, S1651F, T1691I, V1736A, E1735K, H1746Q, and R1753T. T1691I and E1735K were classifi ed as functionally impaired in only one cisplatin sensitivity test, whereas values from repeat experiments could not be taken into account because of RSE values above 0.1. S4F, S1651P, S1651F, V1736A, H1746Q, and R1753T were differently classifi ed in repeat experiments, which may refl ect technical fl aws or intermediate activity of these variants. Of note, the V1736A mutation was recently identifi ed as a pathogenic variant with hypomorphic activity in DNA repair ( 31 ). Although we did not measure signifi cant HR activity of V1736A in a DR-GFP gene conversion assay, intermediate activity of this variant is supported by the results of the proliferation assays and additional cisplatin sensitivity assays. S1651F showed HR activity similar to wild-type BRCA1 , whereas R1753T was HR-defi cient. S308A is an artifi cial mutation of a BRCA1 phosphorylation site that was able to support proliferation and resistance to DNA damage in an embryonic stem cell-based BAC complementation assay. However, S308A-complemented embryonic stem cells did show increased apoptosis when cultured in embryoid bodies ( 7 ), indicating a partial defect that might explain the ambivalent results for this mutation in our assays.  Our results show that BRCA1 variants should ideally be assayed in triplicate to avoid misclassifi cation. This also applies to BRCA1 VUS that we classifi ed as neutral, most of which were tested only once because in our current study we focused on variants that showed functional impairment. The striking restriction of unambiguously predicted pathogenic mutants to the terminal RING and BRCT domains suggests that some plasticity is allowed for the central domain of BRCA1. However, our dataset is still limited and more experiments are required to gain insight into the function of this domain.  Our cDNA-based system allows for several additional functional assays that have been described previously for BAC transgenic embryonic stem cells ( 7 ). These include assays for defects during in vitro and in vivo embryonic stem cell differentiation but also treatments with other cytotoxic agents. As a proof of principle, we investigated the activity of a number of mutants in the response to the PARP inhibitor olaparib. These included M1400V, L1407, and M1411T, which were previously shown to impair PALB2 binding and have a negative effect on BRCA1 function ( 10 ). Although the differences in sensitivity of BRCA1-defi cient versus BRCA1-profi cient embryonic stem cells are larger for olaparib than for cisplatin, increased variation between repeat experiments allowed us to identify functional defects only for L1407 and not for the other two variants in the PALB2 interaction domain, M1400V and M1411T. However, the R1699Q and V1736A variants, which are known to have hypomorphic activity, clearly showed a defect in the response to olaparib. Interestingly, both mutations are in the BRCT domain, and it has recently been shown that mutation of this domain especially confers sensitivity to PARP inhibition ( 41 ). Together, our results show that PARP inhibitor sensitivity assays may have added value, especially for the classifi cation of BRCA1 VUSs with intermediate phenotypes.  Platinum drugs and PARP inhibitors are selectively toxic to BRCA1-defi cient cells because they target HR defi ciency. Although the role of BRCA1 in HR is thought to be essential for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing accumulation of (oncogenic) mutations, other activities may also contribute to its tumor suppression function. These activities Downloaded from cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org on May 26, 2017. Â© 2013 American Association for Cancer Research.

Nevertheless, we observed a good correlation between the results of the cisplatin sensitivity assay and the results of the DR-GFP HR assay. All BRCA1 variants that failed to restore the cisplatin response in Brca1 -null embryonic stem cells were also defective in catalyzing gene conversion, thereby confi rming our functional classifi cation. It will be interesting to see if this holds true for all BRCA1 variants or whether there are also pathogenic mutations that have no effect on HR.  As with any other in vitro approach, our functional complementation assay system might still fail to identify all pathogenic variants because it does not necessarily recapitulate all aspects of BRCA1 function in vivo . A limitation of our cDNA-based assay is also that it cannot be used to investigate effects on mRNA splicing. Although algorithms have been designed to predict possible splice defects, the consequences of mutations outside of the consensus splice sites especially require functional validation experiments. For this purpose, BAC complementation assays ( 7 ), minigene-based splicing assays, or BRCA1 transcript analysis of patient blood samples ( 19 ) may be instrumental. However, transacting factors also affect splicing, and these may be tissue specifi c ( 42 ). A possible solution would be to determine the presence of BRCA1 splice variants in tumor tissue from BRCA1 VUS carriers and use this information to generate a cDNA construct for analysis of the functional consequences. To evaluate BRCA1 VUSs, there remains a need for multifactorial models that combine results from functional assays and in silico analyses with genetic evidence and other information from mutation carriers. This also includes DNA copy number data from tumors from BRCA1 VUS carriers, as it is known that BRCA1- associated breast tumors show distinct genomic aberrations ( 43, 44 ). Our functional assay system does however provide a robust and easily implementable tool for the functional characterization of large numbers of BRCA1 VUSs within the context of the full-length protein. It is our hope that our assay system will fi nd its way to clinical genetics laboratories where it can be used to aid genetic counseling. Ideally, these tests should be coordinated on an international level and in close collaboration with the ENIGMA consortium.\n",

       "            &lt;td class=&quot;fillremaining&quot; title=&quot;Genetic screening of the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 has uncovered a large number of variants of uncertain clinical significance. Here, we use biochemical and cellbased transcriptional assays to assess the structural and functional defects associated with a large set of 117 distinct BRCA1 missense variants within the essential BRCT domain of the BRCA1 protein that have been documented in individuals with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. In the first method, we used limited proteolysis to assess the protein folding stability of each of the mutants compared with the wild-type. In the second method, we used a phosphopeptide pull-down assay to assess the ability of each of the variants to specifically interact with a peptide containing a pSer-X-X-Phe motif, a known functional target of the BRCA1 BRCT domain. Finally, we used transcriptional assays to assess the ability of each BRCT variant to act as a transcriptional activation domain in human cells. Through a correlation of the assay results with available family history and clinical data, we define limits to predict the disease risk associated with each variant. Forty-two of the variants show little effect on function and are likely to represent variants with little or no clinical significance; 50 display a clear functional effect and are likely to represent pathogenic variants; and the remaining 25 variants display intermediate activities. The excellent agreement between the structure/function effects of these mutations and available clinical data supports the notion that functional and structure information can be useful in the development of models to assess cancer risk. Introduction Since the cloning of BRCA1 in 1994, a large effort has been made to sequence the BRCA1 genes of women who are at increased risk for early-onset breast and ovarian cancers (1).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript This effort has revealed several mutations that are strongly linked to cancer. Unfortunately, a large number of rare BRCA1 variants have been uncovered in the human population for which risk assessment has been problematic, due to a lack of informative pedigree data linking each mutation with disease risk. BRCA1 encodes a large, 1,863â€“amino acid nuclear protein that plays a critical role in the response of cells to genotoxic stress (2â€“4). BRCA1 is thought to act as an essential mediator protein in DNA damageâ€“induced nuclear signaling events, in which it interacts with phosphorylated partner proteins such as the DNA helicase, BACH1, the nuclease CtIP, and another signaling protein, Abraxas, to relay signals generated from chromatin surrounding the damage to downstream targets such as DNA repair proteins and factors involved in cell cycle regulation (5â€“11). Interactions with phosphorylated partner proteins are mediated by a tandem pair of repeats at the COOH terminus of BRCA1, termed BRCT repeats (12â€“14). The BRCT repeat region can also act as a transcriptional activation domain when linked to a sequence-specific DNA binding module, and this activity may contribute to the ability of BRCA1 to regulate the expression of genes such as p21 and GADD45 (15,16) and modulate the activity of other transcription factors such as p53 and ER (17,18). The NH2-terminal region of the protein contains a RING domain, which forms a heterodimeric complex with the RING domain of BARD1 to form a ubiquitin ligase (19â€“21). Cancer-associated mutations tend to cluster in the RING and BRCT repeat regions, showing the critical role of these domains in BRCA1 tumor suppression. The BRCA1 BRCT domain specifically interacts with phosphorylated protein targets containing the motif pSer-x-x-Phe. Structural studies have revealed that recognition involves a conserved phosphoserine recognition pocket in the NH2-terminal BRCT repeat, composed of Ser1655, Gly1656, and Lys1702, which each supply ligands to recognize the phosphate (12â€“14). The phenylalanine residue at the +3 position of the peptide target is recognized by a largely hydrophobic groove formed at the interface between the repeats. Phosphopeptide recognition is likely a common function of BRCT domains in many proteins associated with DNA damageâ€“mediated signal transduction. For example, the phosphorylated form of the histone variant, H2AX, which serves as a critical chromatin mark of DNA double-strand breaks, is specifically bound by the tandem BRCT repeats of MDC1 to initiate DNA doublestrand break signaling (22,23). Several studies have attempted to predict the cancer risks associated with unclassified missense variants in BRCA1 through bioinformatics analysis based on multiple sequence alignment data and protein structure prediction, as well as analyses of the clinical and family history data available for some of these mutations (1,24â€“28). These studies indicate that the RING and BRCT domains, which are the most highly conserved regions of BRCA1, likely contain the vast majority of cancer-associated mutations. Here, we use in vitro protein folding, phosphopeptide-binding, and cell-based transcriptional assays to assess the structural and functional consequences of a set of 117 distinct missense variants that have been uncovered in the BRCA1 BRCT domain in the human population. Our results indicate that nearly one half of the BRCT missense variants result in significant structural and/or functional defects that are likely associated with an increased cancer risk. Materials and Methods Proteolysis assays pLM1 plasmid (0.25 Î¼g) encoding the BRCT variants was used directly as template for protein synthesis reactions with the TNT-Quick in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega). Both wild-type and mutant proteins were produced by in vitro transcription/ translation because many mutants could not be expressed in soluble form in Escherichia coli. The stability of the protein fold for the BRCA1 BRCT mutants was tested using Lee et al. Page 2 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript proteolysis assays, as previously reported (29). The measurements were normalized against the internal background, and the control measurements taken in the same day. The missense variants were tested in triplicate. Phosphopeptide-binding assays The BRCT variants were translated and labeled as in proteolysis assays. The ability of the BRCA1 BRCT mutants to bind pSer-containing peptides was tested using peptide-binding assays, as previously reported (14). Bead-immobilized peptide affinity resin was prepared by incubating a 10-fold molar excess of a biotinylated phosphopeptide (SRSTpSPTFNK) and the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide (SRSTSPTFNK) with streptavidin agarose beads (SigmaAldrich). Seven mutants, with the wild-type BRCA1-BRCT (1,646â€“1,858) as a positive control, and M1775R and A1708E as negative controls were examined at a time. The intensities of the bands were measured and the backgrounds were corrected using ImageQuaNT (Amersham Biosciences), and the measurements were normalized against the wild-type measurement taken in the same day. The missense variants were tested in triplicate. Transcriptional assays The construct containing wild-type BRCA1 amino acids 1,646 to 1,859 (wt) was used as a positive control and variants M1775R and Y1853X as negative controls. HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates, 1 Ã— 105  cells per well, and 24 hours later were transfected in triplicates with Fugene 6 according to the manufacturer&amp;#39;s instructions (Roche). The vectors containing the variants were cotransfected with pG5Luc, which contains a firefly luciferase reporter gene driven by GAL4-responsive binding sites, and phGR-TK, which contains a Renilla luciferase gene driven by a constitutive TK basal promoter used as an internal control. Cells were harvested 24 hours after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) following the manufacturer&amp;#39;s instructions. Activity was plotted as a percentage of the wt BRCA1 activity. Thirty-four of 117 variants had already been assessed in previous articles, albeit in different amino acid contexts (amino acids 1,396â€“1863 or aa 1,560â€“1863; refs. 30â€“32). In only one case (G1706A), the qualitative assessment differed because it was considered of moderate effect previously and of no effect in the present study. This shows the high reproducibility of the transcriptional assays. Align-GVGD classification of BRCA1 BRCT variants The 117 BRCT variants were analyzed with the Align-GVGD algorithm at three depths of alignment. Nine mammalian BRCA1 sequences, chicken and one additional sequence (either frog, puffer fish, or sea urchin), were used for the alignment (for more detail, see ref. 33). A-class scores were assigned for variants in which the scores from at least two of three alignments agreed. Definition of a validation set To compile our validation set (Supplementary Table S1; Table 1), we identified variants that had been previously analyzed and classified by genetic (1) or integrative methods (25, 34â€“ 40). Integrative methods use a combination of data from different sources, including cooccurrence with known deleterious mutations, personal and family history of patients carrying the variant, and cosegregation of the variant with disease within pedigrees, to assign an overall risk score. Sufficient data were available to assign 14 of the BRCA1 BRCT variants as associated with disease, whereas 10 of the variants were predicted to be neutral Lee et al. Page 3 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript (Table 1). Where possible, the probability of pathogenicity of each of these variants was classified according to the IARC scheme (Supplementary Table S1; ref. 41). We calculated specificity, sensitivity, and 95% confidence interval measures for each of the structure and functional assays based on a comparison with this variant set (Supplementary Table S2). A description of how the BRCA1 BRCT variant set was obtained is given in Supplementary Materials and Methods. Results Generation of a large set of BRCA1 BRCT missense variants Many of the BRCA1 variants that have been uncovered through worldwide sequencing efforts are now deposited within the Breast Cancer Information Core database (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/) as well as the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for research into Familial Breast Cancer database (http://www.kconfab.org). To facilitate the assessment of the structural and functional defects associated with these mutations, we cloned all the currently available missense variants (Fig. 1) into an E. coli expression vector that we used previously for our structural and functional work of the BRCA1 BRCT domain. This vector places the BRCA1 BRCT coding sequence (corresponding to residues 1,646â€“1,859) under control of a T7 promotor. Using this plasmid system, recombinant protein can be expressed in E. coli and purified using established procedures for detailed biochemical and structural studies. The T7 promoter can also be used for in vitro transcription/translation of the recombinant protein. The in vitro transcription/translation system is rapid and allows the generation of multiple proteins in parallel and, because the recombinant protein is specifically labeled with 35S-methionine, no purification is required. All variants can be successfully made in this system, regardless of their folding stability. This is a further advantage over E. coli expression, in which we have found that only well-folded variants can be expressed in soluble form and purified. Thus, we have used in vitro transcribed/translated material for our structural stability and peptidebinding assays described below. We also evaluated the possibility that some of these variants could result in splicing abnormalities. We used the NNSplice 0.9 algorithm (42) to predict the effects of these changes on the efficiency with the BRCT coding region (see Supplementary Materials). Determination of the protein folding defects associated with BRCT missense variants We used limited proteolysis to determine the stability of the protein fold in the set of BRCA1 BRCT missense variants using in vitro transcribed/translated material (Supplementary Fig. S1). The wild-type protein is highly resistant to digestion by trypsin, elastase, or chymotrypsin, indicating that the in vitro produced BRCT protein is stably folded (43). On the other hand, a pilot study involving 25 of the BRCA1 BRCT missense variants showed that certain single amino acid substitutions in the BRCT domain of BRCA1 can destabilize its structure, leading to increased susceptibility to trypsin-mediated proteolysis (29). The assay is sufficiently sensitive to discriminate wild-type protein from the strongly destabilized variant A1708E as well as the moderately destabilized variant M1775R. Proteolysis of each of the missense variants was carried out at a series of trypsin concentrations, and the amount of full-length protein remaining was visualized by SDSPAGE. The results were compared with those of the wild-type protein as well as the M1775R and A1708E variants carried out in parallel. We quantified the percentages of fulllength protein remaining following digestion at different concentrations of trypsin and determined the severity of the destabilizing effects by comparing the percentage of protein remaining following digestion at 10 Î¼g/mL trypsin to the controls (Supplementary Fig. S2A). We defined highly destabilizing mutations as those with similar rates of digestion to Lee et al. Page 4 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript the A1708E control (&amp;lt;5% of the protein remaining after digestion with 10 Î¼g/mL of trypsin). Moderately destabilizing mutations were defined as those with a similar stability to M1775R (between 5% and 65% of the protein remaining after digestion with 10 Î¼g/mL of trypsin). Finally, structurally stable variants were defined as those with a stability similar to the wild-type protein (&amp;gt;65% of the protein remaining after 10 Î¼g/mL of trypsin digestion). Based on these criteria, 26 of 117 of the missense mutations showed high sensitivity to tryptic digestion; 30 of 117 showed intermediate sensitivity; and 61 of 117 showed a stability that was indistinguishable from the wild-type (Supplementary Figs. S2A and S3). We also noted that the C1697R mutant showed a particularly low protein expression level. Analysis of the phosphopeptide binding activity of BRCT missense variants The BRCA1 BRCT domain interacts with BACH1 and several other proteins through the selective recognition of the peptide motif pSer-x-x-Phe (10â€“14,44). All mutations that have been strongly linked to disease using family-based data, such as A1708E and M1775R (1,35), fail to bind specifically to pSer-x-x-Pheâ€“containing peptides as shown in a pilot study that analyzed the peptide binding activities of 25 BRCA1 BRCT domain variants (14). This indicates the functional importance of the BRCA1 BRCT domain as a phosphopeptidebinding module in tumor suppression. We examined the ability of the BRCT domains containing missense variants to bind peptides derived from BACH1 using a pull-down assay in which biotinylated peptide was bound to streptavidin beads. We tested binding to a phosphorylated version of the peptide containing the BRCA1 target sequence pSer-Pro-Thr-Phe or an unphosphorylated version as a control. The results were compared with experiments with the wild-type BRCA1 BRCT as well as with the peptide bindingâ€“deficient variants A1708E and M1775R carried out in parallel. We present two analyses of the data. In the first analysis, we define â€œbinding activityâ€� as the fraction of the input protein that bound to the phosphorylated peptide, normalized against the binding of the wild-type protein (Supplementary Fig. S2B). In the second analysis, we define â€œbinding specificityâ€� as the ratio of the variant bound to the phosphopeptide compared with the nonphosphorylated counterpart, normalized to the wildtype control (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Classified in this way, we observed a range of binding activities and specificities. As observed for the protein stability assays, the variants tended to cluster near either 100% or 0% activity, with relatively few variants displaying intermediate binding activities/specificities (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thirty-eight of 117 of the variants displayed binding activities &amp;gt;80% of wild-type levels, whereas 35 of 117 variants displayed binding activities &amp;lt;20% of wild-type. The binding specificity analysis revealed 29 of 117 of the variants exhibited &amp;gt;80% of wild-type levels, whereas 50 of 117 of the variants exhibited &amp;lt;20% of wild-type levels. Analysis of the transcriptional activation activity of BRCA1 BRCT variants The transcriptional activation activity of the BRCA1 BRCT domain was the first identified activity of this region of the protein (15,16). Assays for BRCA1 BRCT transcriptional activation have been established in human and yeast cell systems (45). In either method, the BRCT domain is fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain that recognizes a defined regulatory sequence within the promoter of the reporter. Pilot studies involving subsets of the BRCA1 BRCT variants showed that mutations that have been associated with cancer using family-based data abrogate, or markedly diminish, the expression of the reporter gene (31,32,46). Moreover, the fact that mutations that destabilize the BRCT fold are strongly associated with a loss of transactivation function indicates that this assay is a monitor of the integrity of the BRCT domain (29). Lee et al. Page 5 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript As observed for the protein stability and phosphopeptide-binding assays, a wide range of transcriptional activities were observed for the variant set, with the observed values tending to cluster either at very low or very high activity levels (Supplementary Figs. S2D and S3). Thirty-eight of 117 variants displayed transcriptional activity levels at &amp;gt;80% of wild-type, whereas 54 of 117 were found to be &amp;lt;20% of wild-type levels. Correlation of structural and functional data with family history and clinical data The use of functional data in cancer risk assessment is predicated on rigorous validation of the results against sets of variants for which cancer risks are well defined. Easton and colleagues (35) have assigned risks based on genetic data for a large number of BRCA1 variants. We used these data, together with available genetic information for several other variants (25,34â€“40), to create a validation set of 24 variants, consisting of 14 deleterious mutations and 10 neutral variants (Table 1). We plotted the protein stability, peptide binding, and transcriptional activity data against the combined log10 likelihood ratio scores for the subset of 19 variants analyzed by Easton and colleagues (Fig. 2; likelihood ratio). In general, this analysis revealed a clear correlation between structural/functional defects and cancer risk (35). A comparison of all the genetically characterized variants with the experimental results is shown in Table 1. This comparison was used to define the sensitivities and specificities of the functional assays. Sensitivity ranged from 81.8% for phosphopeptide binding activity to 100% for phosphopeptide binding specificity and transcription assays. Specificity ranged from 75% for proteolysis assays to 87.5% for transcription assays, to 100% for binding activity assays (Supplementary Table S2). Although overall there is a good agreement between the assessed cancer risks and the functional activities of the variants, there are several variants in which cancer risk assessment and the structure/function results do not agree. For example, a significant number of cancer-associated (IARC classes 5 and 4) variants are not structurally destabilized as determined by the proteolysis assay. Each of these variants (R1699W, M1775R, and M1775K) is highly defective for specific phosphopeptide recognition and transcriptional activity. Structural studies reveal that both Arg1699 and Met1775 make critical direct contacts to the phosphopeptide (12â€“14), and structural investigations of the M1775R and M1775K variants reveal subtle structural rearrangements that block the +3 specificity pocket (37,47). Two of the cancer-associated (IARC class 5) variants, I1766S and G1788V, were highly defective in the proteolysis and transcriptional assays; however, they showed significant levels of nonspecific peptide binding, independent of phosphorylation. It is likely that the unfolded state of these variants exposes hydrophobic residues that are responsible for these nonspecific interactions, as suggested previously (14). G1706E, one of the cancer-associated (IARC class 5) variants, is defective in the proteolysis and peptidebinding assays; however, it shows an intermediate level of transcriptional activity. The neutral (IARC class 1) variant V1736A exhibited the least agreement between the different assays, showing significant sensitivity to proteolysis and a strong transcriptional defect while showing intermediate/strong levels of phosphopeptide interaction. Considering the overall high specificity and sensitivity obtained in the assays (Supplementary Table S2), we have defined limits to predict disease association for the uncharacterized variants based on the biochemical and transcriptional assay data (Table 1; Fig. 2). It is important to stress that the definition of these limits should not be used for classifying variants in terms of their pathogenicity in the absence of additional data. The cancer-associated (IARC classes 5 and 4) variants in general exhibited protein stability levels &amp;lt;58% of the wild-type, phosphopeptide binding activities &amp;lt;32% of wild-type, phosphopeptide specificity binding activities &amp;lt;21% of wild-type, and transcriptional activation function &amp;lt;35% of wild-type levels. Conversely, the neutral variants (IARC classes 1 and 2) in general had protein stability levels &amp;gt;59% of the wild-type, phosphopeptide Lee et al. Page 6 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript binding activities &amp;gt;67% of wild-type, phosphopeptide specificity binding activities &amp;gt;49% of wild-type, and transcriptional activation function &amp;gt;76% of wild-type levels. Variants falling between these limits are defined as uncertain. Using these limits, we have defined the structure and functional activities of each of the variants (Fig. 3). Comparison of results from different assays and overall classification Next, we compared the results from the different assays for the entire set of variants (Fig. 3). In 64 of 117 (54.7%) of the variants, there was complete concordance between the different assays, with 35 of 117 (29.9%) giving protein stability, peptide binding, and transcription activities within the limits that correspond to neutral variants in IARC classes 1 and 2, whereas 29 of 117 (24.8%) exhibited values in the range corresponding to cancer-associated (IARC classes 4 and 5) variants for each of the assays. Based on these results, we have classified the variants into groups based on their functional effect (Table 2). Although classification is straightforward for those variants in which there is a complete agreement between the different assays, for the variants in which there is not a complete agreement, classification is more complex. The largest class of discordant results includes variants that exhibit defects in binding and transcription but little or no folding defect (6 of 117 variants or 5.1%). These variants likely directly affect the phosphopeptide binding surface and may only affect residues that are exposed to the solvent preserving the overall fold structure. Because phosphopeptide recognition is critical for the tumorsuppressive function of BRCA1 (14,48), we have therefore included these variants in the strong functional effect class. Likewise, severely destabilized variants that show significant levels of phosphorylation-independent peptide binding but a strong transcriptional defect have also been categorized as strong functional effect (Table 2). We have also described eight of the variants as of â€œmoderate functional effectâ€� in which a preponderance of the data points to a loss of function. These include variants with intermediate levels of peptide binding specificity (W1837G and A1843P) or transcriptional activity (V1696L, G1706E, and H1746N), and strong defects in all of the other assays. In addition, we have included three additional mutants in this group that show poor agreement between the different assays but are likely to directly affect the peptide-binding surface. S1655F is predicted to impede recognition of the phosphoserine in the bound peptide, whereas G1656D could perturb the structure of the phosphoserine-binding pocket, and the introduction of a negatively charged side chain in this region would be expected to further inhibit phosphopeptide recognition. R1699L would remove a critical determinant for recognition of the phenylalanine residue at the +3 position of the phosphopeptide, and indeed, the similar R1699W variant is pathogenic (IARC class 5; Table 1). We predict a given variant to be neutral when each of the assays gives values similar to wild-type within the limits defined by comparison with the set of variants that have been characterized through family history and genetic data. In addition, we define a set of seven variants as â€œlow functional effectâ€� that display an intermediate activity for one of the assays and wild-type levels for the other three. Finally, there is a group of 25 variants (21.4%) that we define as â€œuncertain.â€� In general, these variants show a poor level of agreement between the different assays, and a significant number of assay results in the intermediate range. Correlation of mutant classification with predictions from Align-GVGD The Align-GVGD method (http://agvgd.iarc.fr/agvgd_input.php) uses protein multiple sequence alignment (PMSA) data to provide cancer risk estimates for BRCA1 mutations (33). In this method, each missense variant is classified based on the observed amino acid Lee et al. Page 7 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript fluctuation at that position in the PMSA (the Grantham variance, GV) as well as a comparison of the amino acid substitution with the range of amino acids observed at that position (Grantham difference, GD). In this way, seven classes of variants (C0, C15, C25, C35, C45, C55, and C65) that represent a graded series of GV-GD scores were defined. Variants in the C0 class correspond to variants that are well conserved in the PMSA and are therefore predicted to be neutral, whereas the C65 class contains missense variants that deviate from the PMSA and likely associated with an increased cancer risk. To assess the accuracy of the Align GV-GD method, we compared Align GV-GD scores to the results for the structure/function assays (Fig. 4). For the variants with no functional effect, a large majority (28 of 35, 80%) falls into the C0 class, three are classified as C15, and two are classified as C25. Only one of them, G1706A, received a high score in Align GV-GD, C55. Another variant at this position (G1706E) scored as C65, but this variant was classified with moderate functional effect by structure/function assays. These results suggest substitution of a small side chain at position 1,706 is tolerated, but not substitution of the larger, charged Glu. For the variants with strong functional effect, 25 of 42 (59.5%) are in the C65 class and 16 are spread throughout classes C15 to C55 (Fig. 4B). One missense variant (A1752P) was classified C0, but this variant shows strong defect in all assays. The substitution of a proline at position 1,752 likely destabilizes the linker Î±-helix, which may be responsible for the strong folding defect associated with this variant. Overall, there is strong agreement between Align GV-GD predictions and the results of functional assays, indicating that sequence alignmentâ€“based predictive methods can offer a valuable measure of risk assessment for variants in which there is no direct functional data. Discussion Here, we present the first comprehensive assessment of the structural and functional consequences of 117 BRCA1 variants corresponding to the complete set of BRCT missense variants detected to date in the human population (100% coverage). Our protein structure assay, peptide binding, and transcriptional assays show a remarkable degree of agreement and give us confidence in the validity of these results. Correlation of this experimental data with the available clinical and family history data for a subset of these variants defines limits that can be used to tentatively predict functional effect that is likely to be reflected in the disease risk associated with these variants. In this way, we show that 42.7% of the variants fall into the â€œclear functional effectâ€� or â€œmoderate functional effectâ€� categories (Table 2) and are likely associated with an increased cancer risk, whereas 35.9% fall into the â€œno functional effectâ€� or â€œlow functional effectâ€� categories. The remaining 21.4% falls into the uncertain category and could perhaps represent low-penetrance variants. The fact that a large proportion of variants tested displayed some functional effect lends support to the idea of applying higher prior probabilities for causality to variants found in the BRCT domains (35). The BRCA1 BRCT variant set provides a useful set of reagents for further detailed study of variants of particular interest. For example, variants that are moderately well folded based on proteolytic stability can often be purified and studied in more detail. Circular dicroism spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry have been used to quantitatively assess the fold stability of V1696L, R1699W, M1775K, M1775R, M1783T, V1808A, V1809F, and V1833M (49â€“51). Although our proteolytic assay indicated that the stability of two of these variants, R1699W and V1808A, were indistinguishable from wild-type, the more sensitive thermodynamic studies of the purified forms of these variants reveal a small but significant reduction in fold stability. In addition, quantitative assays of phosphopeptide binding, such as isothermal titration calorimetry, can reveal the detailed thermodynamics of peptide-BRCT interactions (50,51). The structural rearrangements induced by three of these variants, M1775R (47), M1775K (37), and V1809F (14), have been visualized through Lee et al. Page 8 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript crystallographic structural analysis. Each of the variants affect the +3 specificity pocket formed at the interface between the two BRCT repeats. For M1775R and M1775K, the substituted positively charged side chain adopts an orientation that fills the specificity pocket and blocks the binding of the Phe side chain at the +3 position of the target peptide. Intriguingly, the V1809F substitution, which occurs far from the +3 pocket, induces a series of conformational adjustments that results in the movement of Met1775 to fill the specificity pocket, explaining the loss of peptide binding specificity and transcriptional activity associated with this variant. Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that lead to amino acid substitutions are likely to have diverse phenotypic consequences and implications for human disease. Although computational methods have been proposed to assess the effect of individual SNPs (52), relatively little has been done at the experimental level to provide insight into the effects of SNPs. The database of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations provides an important first look at the kind of genetic diversity that exists in the human population. Another example of a large mutation database is that assembled for mutations found in p53 from human tumors. Detailed studies of the stability of the p53 DNA binding domain indicate that, like the BRCA1 BRCT domain, this relatively unstable domain is sensitive to mutations that destabilize the protein fold in addition to other classes of mutations that do not significantly affect protein fold stability but instead modify DNA-binding or proteinprotein interaction surfaces (53). Thus, rapid, general assays of protein structure and function such as the proteolysis assay used here could potentially prove useful for the rapid, high-throughput assessment of the effect of SNPs on protein function. Ultimately, unambiguous classification of variants, as proposed by the IARC Unclassified Genetic variants Working Group (41), will need a comprehensive integrative model to incorporate data from several sources. Robust integrative models have been proposed but they still lack a coherent framework to incorporate functional data. A major roadblock in the development of such a model was the lack of an established series of functional assays with standardized controls, validated against available genetic data. The present study fills this gap and allows for the development of better predictive models. Although a systematic large-scale classification of all BRCA1 variants into the IARC classes has not yet been done, it is expected that a large number will fall into class 3 (uncertain), due to the lack of genetic-based data. Conceivably, even large-scale efforts may not be able to gather sufficient genetic data on individual variants because most are extremely rare. Thus, we anticipate that the use of structural and functional information will be instrumental to move variants from the class 3 into classes that provide a basis for better risk assessment and clinical decisions. In addition, the fact that variants can now also be functionally and structurally rationalized will provide an impulse for further functional dissection of the tumor-suppressive activities of BRCA1.&quot;&gt;\n",
       "                Genetic screening of the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 has uncovered a large number of variants of uncertain clinical significance. Here, we use biochemical and cellbased transcriptional assays to assess the structural and functional defects associated with a large set of 117 distinct BRCA1 missense variants within the essential BRCT domain of the BRCA1 protein that have been documented in individuals with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. In the first method, we used limited proteolysis to assess the protein folding stability of each of the mutants compared with the wild-type. In the second method, we used a phosphopeptide pull-down assay to assess the ability of each of the variants to specifically interact with a peptide containing a pSer-X-X-Phe motif, a known functional target of the BRCA1 BRCT domain. Finally, we used transcriptional assays to assess the ability of each BRCT variant to act as a transcriptional activation domain in human cells. Through a correlation of the assay results with available family history and clinical data, we define limits to predict the disease risk associated with each variant. Forty-two of the variants show little effect on function and are likely to represent variants with little or no clinical significance; 50 display a clear functional effect and are likely to represent pathogenic variants; and the remaining 25 variants display intermediate activities. The excellent agreement between the structure/function effects of these mutations and available clinical data supports the notion that functional and structure information can be useful in the development of models to assess cancer risk. Introduction Since the cloning of BRCA1 in 1994, a large effort has been made to sequence the BRCA1 genes of women who are at increased risk for early-onset breast and ovarian cancers (1).

Published in final edited form as: Cancer Res. 2010 June 15; 70(12): 4880â€“4890. doi:10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-4563. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript This effort has revealed several mutations that are strongly linked to cancer. Unfortunately, a large number of rare BRCA1 variants have been uncovered in the human population for which risk assessment has been problematic, due to a lack of informative pedigree data linking each mutation with disease risk. BRCA1 encodes a large, 1,863â€“amino acid nuclear protein that plays a critical role in the response of cells to genotoxic stress (2â€“4). BRCA1 is thought to act as an essential mediator protein in DNA damageâ€“induced nuclear signaling events, in which it interacts with phosphorylated partner proteins such as the DNA helicase, BACH1, the nuclease CtIP, and another signaling protein, Abraxas, to relay signals generated from chromatin surrounding the damage to downstream targets such as DNA repair proteins and factors involved in cell cycle regulation (5â€“11). Interactions with phosphorylated partner proteins are mediated by a tandem pair of repeats at the COOH terminus of BRCA1, termed BRCT repeats (12â€“14). The BRCT repeat region can also act as a transcriptional activation domain when linked to a sequence-specific DNA binding module, and this activity may contribute to the ability of BRCA1 to regulate the expression of genes such as p21 and GADD45 (15,16) and modulate the activity of other transcription factors such as p53 and ER (17,18). The NH2-terminal region of the protein contains a RING domain, which forms a heterodimeric complex with the RING domain of BARD1 to form a ubiquitin ligase (19â€“21). Cancer-associated mutations tend to cluster in the RING and BRCT repeat regions, showing the critical role of these domains in BRCA1 tumor suppression. The BRCA1 BRCT domain specifically interacts with phosphorylated protein targets containing the motif pSer-x-x-Phe. Structural studies have revealed that recognition involves a conserved phosphoserine recognition pocket in the NH2-terminal BRCT repeat, composed of Ser1655, Gly1656, and Lys1702, which each supply ligands to recognize the phosphate (12â€“14). The phenylalanine residue at the +3 position of the peptide target is recognized by a largely hydrophobic groove formed at the interface between the repeats. Phosphopeptide recognition is likely a common function of BRCT domains in many proteins associated with DNA damageâ€“mediated signal transduction. For example, the phosphorylated form of the histone variant, H2AX, which serves as a critical chromatin mark of DNA double-strand breaks, is specifically bound by the tandem BRCT repeats of MDC1 to initiate DNA doublestrand break signaling (22,23). Several studies have attempted to predict the cancer risks associated with unclassified missense variants in BRCA1 through bioinformatics analysis based on multiple sequence alignment data and protein structure prediction, as well as analyses of the clinical and family history data available for some of these mutations (1,24â€“28). These studies indicate that the RING and BRCT domains, which are the most highly conserved regions of BRCA1, likely contain the vast majority of cancer-associated mutations. Here, we use in vitro protein folding, phosphopeptide-binding, and cell-based transcriptional assays to assess the structural and functional consequences of a set of 117 distinct missense variants that have been uncovered in the BRCA1 BRCT domain in the human population. Our results indicate that nearly one half of the BRCT missense variants result in significant structural and/or functional defects that are likely associated with an increased cancer risk. Materials and Methods Proteolysis assays pLM1 plasmid (0.25 Î¼g) encoding the BRCT variants was used directly as template for protein synthesis reactions with the TNT-Quick in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega). Both wild-type and mutant proteins were produced by in vitro transcription/ translation because many mutants could not be expressed in soluble form in Escherichia coli. The stability of the protein fold for the BRCA1 BRCT mutants was tested using Lee et al. Page 2 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript proteolysis assays, as previously reported (29). The measurements were normalized against the internal background, and the control measurements taken in the same day. The missense variants were tested in triplicate. Phosphopeptide-binding assays The BRCT variants were translated and labeled as in proteolysis assays. The ability of the BRCA1 BRCT mutants to bind pSer-containing peptides was tested using peptide-binding assays, as previously reported (14). Bead-immobilized peptide affinity resin was prepared by incubating a 10-fold molar excess of a biotinylated phosphopeptide (SRSTpSPTFNK) and the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide (SRSTSPTFNK) with streptavidin agarose beads (SigmaAldrich). Seven mutants, with the wild-type BRCA1-BRCT (1,646â€“1,858) as a positive control, and M1775R and A1708E as negative controls were examined at a time. The intensities of the bands were measured and the backgrounds were corrected using ImageQuaNT (Amersham Biosciences), and the measurements were normalized against the wild-type measurement taken in the same day. The missense variants were tested in triplicate. Transcriptional assays The construct containing wild-type BRCA1 amino acids 1,646 to 1,859 (wt) was used as a positive control and variants M1775R and Y1853X as negative controls. HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates, 1 Ã— 105  cells per well, and 24 hours later were transfected in triplicates with Fugene 6 according to the manufacturer&amp;#39;s instructions (Roche). The vectors containing the variants were cotransfected with pG5Luc, which contains a firefly luciferase reporter gene driven by GAL4-responsive binding sites, and phGR-TK, which contains a Renilla luciferase gene driven by a constitutive TK basal promoter used as an internal control. Cells were harvested 24 hours after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) following the manufacturer&amp;#39;s instructions. Activity was plotted as a percentage of the wt BRCA1 activity. Thirty-four of 117 variants had already been assessed in previous articles, albeit in different amino acid contexts (amino acids 1,396â€“1863 or aa 1,560â€“1863; refs. 30â€“32). In only one case (G1706A), the qualitative assessment differed because it was considered of moderate effect previously and of no effect in the present study. This shows the high reproducibility of the transcriptional assays. Align-GVGD classification of BRCA1 BRCT variants The 117 BRCT variants were analyzed with the Align-GVGD algorithm at three depths of alignment. Nine mammalian BRCA1 sequences, chicken and one additional sequence (either frog, puffer fish, or sea urchin), were used for the alignment (for more detail, see ref. 33). A-class scores were assigned for variants in which the scores from at least two of three alignments agreed. Definition of a validation set To compile our validation set (Supplementary Table S1; Table 1), we identified variants that had been previously analyzed and classified by genetic (1) or integrative methods (25, 34â€“ 40). Integrative methods use a combination of data from different sources, including cooccurrence with known deleterious mutations, personal and family history of patients carrying the variant, and cosegregation of the variant with disease within pedigrees, to assign an overall risk score. Sufficient data were available to assign 14 of the BRCA1 BRCT variants as associated with disease, whereas 10 of the variants were predicted to be neutral Lee et al. Page 3 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript (Table 1). Where possible, the probability of pathogenicity of each of these variants was classified according to the IARC scheme (Supplementary Table S1; ref. 41). We calculated specificity, sensitivity, and 95% confidence interval measures for each of the structure and functional assays based on a comparison with this variant set (Supplementary Table S2). A description of how the BRCA1 BRCT variant set was obtained is given in Supplementary Materials and Methods. Results Generation of a large set of BRCA1 BRCT missense variants Many of the BRCA1 variants that have been uncovered through worldwide sequencing efforts are now deposited within the Breast Cancer Information Core database (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/) as well as the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for research into Familial Breast Cancer database (http://www.kconfab.org). To facilitate the assessment of the structural and functional defects associated with these mutations, we cloned all the currently available missense variants (Fig. 1) into an E. coli expression vector that we used previously for our structural and functional work of the BRCA1 BRCT domain. This vector places the BRCA1 BRCT coding sequence (corresponding to residues 1,646â€“1,859) under control of a T7 promotor. Using this plasmid system, recombinant protein can be expressed in E. coli and purified using established procedures for detailed biochemical and structural studies. The T7 promoter can also be used for in vitro transcription/translation of the recombinant protein. The in vitro transcription/translation system is rapid and allows the generation of multiple proteins in parallel and, because the recombinant protein is specifically labeled with 35S-methionine, no purification is required. All variants can be successfully made in this system, regardless of their folding stability. This is a further advantage over E. coli expression, in which we have found that only well-folded variants can be expressed in soluble form and purified. Thus, we have used in vitro transcribed/translated material for our structural stability and peptidebinding assays described below. We also evaluated the possibility that some of these variants could result in splicing abnormalities. We used the NNSplice 0.9 algorithm (42) to predict the effects of these changes on the efficiency with the BRCT coding region (see Supplementary Materials). Determination of the protein folding defects associated with BRCT missense variants We used limited proteolysis to determine the stability of the protein fold in the set of BRCA1 BRCT missense variants using in vitro transcribed/translated material (Supplementary Fig. S1). The wild-type protein is highly resistant to digestion by trypsin, elastase, or chymotrypsin, indicating that the in vitro produced BRCT protein is stably folded (43). On the other hand, a pilot study involving 25 of the BRCA1 BRCT missense variants showed that certain single amino acid substitutions in the BRCT domain of BRCA1 can destabilize its structure, leading to increased susceptibility to trypsin-mediated proteolysis (29). The assay is sufficiently sensitive to discriminate wild-type protein from the strongly destabilized variant A1708E as well as the moderately destabilized variant M1775R. Proteolysis of each of the missense variants was carried out at a series of trypsin concentrations, and the amount of full-length protein remaining was visualized by SDSPAGE. The results were compared with those of the wild-type protein as well as the M1775R and A1708E variants carried out in parallel. We quantified the percentages of fulllength protein remaining following digestion at different concentrations of trypsin and determined the severity of the destabilizing effects by comparing the percentage of protein remaining following digestion at 10 Î¼g/mL trypsin to the controls (Supplementary Fig. S2A). We defined highly destabilizing mutations as those with similar rates of digestion to Lee et al. Page 4 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript the A1708E control (&amp;lt;5% of the protein remaining after digestion with 10 Î¼g/mL of trypsin). Moderately destabilizing mutations were defined as those with a similar stability to M1775R (between 5% and 65% of the protein remaining after digestion with 10 Î¼g/mL of trypsin). Finally, structurally stable variants were defined as those with a stability similar to the wild-type protein (&amp;gt;65% of the protein remaining after 10 Î¼g/mL of trypsin digestion). Based on these criteria, 26 of 117 of the missense mutations showed high sensitivity to tryptic digestion; 30 of 117 showed intermediate sensitivity; and 61 of 117 showed a stability that was indistinguishable from the wild-type (Supplementary Figs. S2A and S3). We also noted that the C1697R mutant showed a particularly low protein expression level. Analysis of the phosphopeptide binding activity of BRCT missense variants The BRCA1 BRCT domain interacts with BACH1 and several other proteins through the selective recognition of the peptide motif pSer-x-x-Phe (10â€“14,44). All mutations that have been strongly linked to disease using family-based data, such as A1708E and M1775R (1,35), fail to bind specifically to pSer-x-x-Pheâ€“containing peptides as shown in a pilot study that analyzed the peptide binding activities of 25 BRCA1 BRCT domain variants (14). This indicates the functional importance of the BRCA1 BRCT domain as a phosphopeptidebinding module in tumor suppression. We examined the ability of the BRCT domains containing missense variants to bind peptides derived from BACH1 using a pull-down assay in which biotinylated peptide was bound to streptavidin beads. We tested binding to a phosphorylated version of the peptide containing the BRCA1 target sequence pSer-Pro-Thr-Phe or an unphosphorylated version as a control. The results were compared with experiments with the wild-type BRCA1 BRCT as well as with the peptide bindingâ€“deficient variants A1708E and M1775R carried out in parallel. We present two analyses of the data. In the first analysis, we define â€œbinding activityâ€� as the fraction of the input protein that bound to the phosphorylated peptide, normalized against the binding of the wild-type protein (Supplementary Fig. S2B). In the second analysis, we define â€œbinding specificityâ€� as the ratio of the variant bound to the phosphopeptide compared with the nonphosphorylated counterpart, normalized to the wildtype control (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Classified in this way, we observed a range of binding activities and specificities. As observed for the protein stability assays, the variants tended to cluster near either 100% or 0% activity, with relatively few variants displaying intermediate binding activities/specificities (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thirty-eight of 117 of the variants displayed binding activities &amp;gt;80% of wild-type levels, whereas 35 of 117 variants displayed binding activities &amp;lt;20% of wild-type. The binding specificity analysis revealed 29 of 117 of the variants exhibited &amp;gt;80% of wild-type levels, whereas 50 of 117 of the variants exhibited &amp;lt;20% of wild-type levels. Analysis of the transcriptional activation activity of BRCA1 BRCT variants The transcriptional activation activity of the BRCA1 BRCT domain was the first identified activity of this region of the protein (15,16). Assays for BRCA1 BRCT transcriptional activation have been established in human and yeast cell systems (45). In either method, the BRCT domain is fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain that recognizes a defined regulatory sequence within the promoter of the reporter. Pilot studies involving subsets of the BRCA1 BRCT variants showed that mutations that have been associated with cancer using family-based data abrogate, or markedly diminish, the expression of the reporter gene (31,32,46). Moreover, the fact that mutations that destabilize the BRCT fold are strongly associated with a loss of transactivation function indicates that this assay is a monitor of the integrity of the BRCT domain (29). Lee et al. Page 5 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript As observed for the protein stability and phosphopeptide-binding assays, a wide range of transcriptional activities were observed for the variant set, with the observed values tending to cluster either at very low or very high activity levels (Supplementary Figs. S2D and S3). Thirty-eight of 117 variants displayed transcriptional activity levels at &amp;gt;80% of wild-type, whereas 54 of 117 were found to be &amp;lt;20% of wild-type levels. Correlation of structural and functional data with family history and clinical data The use of functional data in cancer risk assessment is predicated on rigorous validation of the results against sets of variants for which cancer risks are well defined. Easton and colleagues (35) have assigned risks based on genetic data for a large number of BRCA1 variants. We used these data, together with available genetic information for several other variants (25,34â€“40), to create a validation set of 24 variants, consisting of 14 deleterious mutations and 10 neutral variants (Table 1). We plotted the protein stability, peptide binding, and transcriptional activity data against the combined log10 likelihood ratio scores for the subset of 19 variants analyzed by Easton and colleagues (Fig. 2; likelihood ratio). In general, this analysis revealed a clear correlation between structural/functional defects and cancer risk (35). A comparison of all the genetically characterized variants with the experimental results is shown in Table 1. This comparison was used to define the sensitivities and specificities of the functional assays. Sensitivity ranged from 81.8% for phosphopeptide binding activity to 100% for phosphopeptide binding specificity and transcription assays. Specificity ranged from 75% for proteolysis assays to 87.5% for transcription assays, to 100% for binding activity assays (Supplementary Table S2). Although overall there is a good agreement between the assessed cancer risks and the functional activities of the variants, there are several variants in which cancer risk assessment and the structure/function results do not agree. For example, a significant number of cancer-associated (IARC classes 5 and 4) variants are not structurally destabilized as determined by the proteolysis assay. Each of these variants (R1699W, M1775R, and M1775K) is highly defective for specific phosphopeptide recognition and transcriptional activity. Structural studies reveal that both Arg1699 and Met1775 make critical direct contacts to the phosphopeptide (12â€“14), and structural investigations of the M1775R and M1775K variants reveal subtle structural rearrangements that block the +3 specificity pocket (37,47). Two of the cancer-associated (IARC class 5) variants, I1766S and G1788V, were highly defective in the proteolysis and transcriptional assays; however, they showed significant levels of nonspecific peptide binding, independent of phosphorylation. It is likely that the unfolded state of these variants exposes hydrophobic residues that are responsible for these nonspecific interactions, as suggested previously (14). G1706E, one of the cancer-associated (IARC class 5) variants, is defective in the proteolysis and peptidebinding assays; however, it shows an intermediate level of transcriptional activity. The neutral (IARC class 1) variant V1736A exhibited the least agreement between the different assays, showing significant sensitivity to proteolysis and a strong transcriptional defect while showing intermediate/strong levels of phosphopeptide interaction. Considering the overall high specificity and sensitivity obtained in the assays (Supplementary Table S2), we have defined limits to predict disease association for the uncharacterized variants based on the biochemical and transcriptional assay data (Table 1; Fig. 2). It is important to stress that the definition of these limits should not be used for classifying variants in terms of their pathogenicity in the absence of additional data. The cancer-associated (IARC classes 5 and 4) variants in general exhibited protein stability levels &amp;lt;58% of the wild-type, phosphopeptide binding activities &amp;lt;32% of wild-type, phosphopeptide specificity binding activities &amp;lt;21% of wild-type, and transcriptional activation function &amp;lt;35% of wild-type levels. Conversely, the neutral variants (IARC classes 1 and 2) in general had protein stability levels &amp;gt;59% of the wild-type, phosphopeptide Lee et al. Page 6 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript binding activities &amp;gt;67% of wild-type, phosphopeptide specificity binding activities &amp;gt;49% of wild-type, and transcriptional activation function &amp;gt;76% of wild-type levels. Variants falling between these limits are defined as uncertain. Using these limits, we have defined the structure and functional activities of each of the variants (Fig. 3). Comparison of results from different assays and overall classification Next, we compared the results from the different assays for the entire set of variants (Fig. 3). In 64 of 117 (54.7%) of the variants, there was complete concordance between the different assays, with 35 of 117 (29.9%) giving protein stability, peptide binding, and transcription activities within the limits that correspond to neutral variants in IARC classes 1 and 2, whereas 29 of 117 (24.8%) exhibited values in the range corresponding to cancer-associated (IARC classes 4 and 5) variants for each of the assays. Based on these results, we have classified the variants into groups based on their functional effect (Table 2). Although classification is straightforward for those variants in which there is a complete agreement between the different assays, for the variants in which there is not a complete agreement, classification is more complex. The largest class of discordant results includes variants that exhibit defects in binding and transcription but little or no folding defect (6 of 117 variants or 5.1%). These variants likely directly affect the phosphopeptide binding surface and may only affect residues that are exposed to the solvent preserving the overall fold structure. Because phosphopeptide recognition is critical for the tumorsuppressive function of BRCA1 (14,48), we have therefore included these variants in the strong functional effect class. Likewise, severely destabilized variants that show significant levels of phosphorylation-independent peptide binding but a strong transcriptional defect have also been categorized as strong functional effect (Table 2). We have also described eight of the variants as of â€œmoderate functional effectâ€� in which a preponderance of the data points to a loss of function. These include variants with intermediate levels of peptide binding specificity (W1837G and A1843P) or transcriptional activity (V1696L, G1706E, and H1746N), and strong defects in all of the other assays. In addition, we have included three additional mutants in this group that show poor agreement between the different assays but are likely to directly affect the peptide-binding surface. S1655F is predicted to impede recognition of the phosphoserine in the bound peptide, whereas G1656D could perturb the structure of the phosphoserine-binding pocket, and the introduction of a negatively charged side chain in this region would be expected to further inhibit phosphopeptide recognition. R1699L would remove a critical determinant for recognition of the phenylalanine residue at the +3 position of the phosphopeptide, and indeed, the similar R1699W variant is pathogenic (IARC class 5; Table 1). We predict a given variant to be neutral when each of the assays gives values similar to wild-type within the limits defined by comparison with the set of variants that have been characterized through family history and genetic data. In addition, we define a set of seven variants as â€œlow functional effectâ€� that display an intermediate activity for one of the assays and wild-type levels for the other three. Finally, there is a group of 25 variants (21.4%) that we define as â€œuncertain.â€� In general, these variants show a poor level of agreement between the different assays, and a significant number of assay results in the intermediate range. Correlation of mutant classification with predictions from Align-GVGD The Align-GVGD method (http://agvgd.iarc.fr/agvgd_input.php) uses protein multiple sequence alignment (PMSA) data to provide cancer risk estimates for BRCA1 mutations (33). In this method, each missense variant is classified based on the observed amino acid Lee et al. Page 7 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript fluctuation at that position in the PMSA (the Grantham variance, GV) as well as a comparison of the amino acid substitution with the range of amino acids observed at that position (Grantham difference, GD). In this way, seven classes of variants (C0, C15, C25, C35, C45, C55, and C65) that represent a graded series of GV-GD scores were defined. Variants in the C0 class correspond to variants that are well conserved in the PMSA and are therefore predicted to be neutral, whereas the C65 class contains missense variants that deviate from the PMSA and likely associated with an increased cancer risk. To assess the accuracy of the Align GV-GD method, we compared Align GV-GD scores to the results for the structure/function assays (Fig. 4). For the variants with no functional effect, a large majority (28 of 35, 80%) falls into the C0 class, three are classified as C15, and two are classified as C25. Only one of them, G1706A, received a high score in Align GV-GD, C55. Another variant at this position (G1706E) scored as C65, but this variant was classified with moderate functional effect by structure/function assays. These results suggest substitution of a small side chain at position 1,706 is tolerated, but not substitution of the larger, charged Glu. For the variants with strong functional effect, 25 of 42 (59.5%) are in the C65 class and 16 are spread throughout classes C15 to C55 (Fig. 4B). One missense variant (A1752P) was classified C0, but this variant shows strong defect in all assays. The substitution of a proline at position 1,752 likely destabilizes the linker Î±-helix, which may be responsible for the strong folding defect associated with this variant. Overall, there is strong agreement between Align GV-GD predictions and the results of functional assays, indicating that sequence alignmentâ€“based predictive methods can offer a valuable measure of risk assessment for variants in which there is no direct functional data. Discussion Here, we present the first comprehensive assessment of the structural and functional consequences of 117 BRCA1 variants corresponding to the complete set of BRCT missense variants detected to date in the human population (100% coverage). Our protein structure assay, peptide binding, and transcriptional assays show a remarkable degree of agreement and give us confidence in the validity of these results. Correlation of this experimental data with the available clinical and family history data for a subset of these variants defines limits that can be used to tentatively predict functional effect that is likely to be reflected in the disease risk associated with these variants. In this way, we show that 42.7% of the variants fall into the â€œclear functional effectâ€� or â€œmoderate functional effectâ€� categories (Table 2) and are likely associated with an increased cancer risk, whereas 35.9% fall into the â€œno functional effectâ€� or â€œlow functional effectâ€� categories. The remaining 21.4% falls into the uncertain category and could perhaps represent low-penetrance variants. The fact that a large proportion of variants tested displayed some functional effect lends support to the idea of applying higher prior probabilities for causality to variants found in the BRCT domains (35). The BRCA1 BRCT variant set provides a useful set of reagents for further detailed study of variants of particular interest. For example, variants that are moderately well folded based on proteolytic stability can often be purified and studied in more detail. Circular dicroism spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry have been used to quantitatively assess the fold stability of V1696L, R1699W, M1775K, M1775R, M1783T, V1808A, V1809F, and V1833M (49â€“51). Although our proteolytic assay indicated that the stability of two of these variants, R1699W and V1808A, were indistinguishable from wild-type, the more sensitive thermodynamic studies of the purified forms of these variants reveal a small but significant reduction in fold stability. In addition, quantitative assays of phosphopeptide binding, such as isothermal titration calorimetry, can reveal the detailed thermodynamics of peptide-BRCT interactions (50,51). The structural rearrangements induced by three of these variants, M1775R (47), M1775K (37), and V1809F (14), have been visualized through Lee et al. Page 8 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript crystallographic structural analysis. Each of the variants affect the +3 specificity pocket formed at the interface between the two BRCT repeats. For M1775R and M1775K, the substituted positively charged side chain adopts an orientation that fills the specificity pocket and blocks the binding of the Phe side chain at the +3 position of the target peptide. Intriguingly, the V1809F substitution, which occurs far from the +3 pocket, induces a series of conformational adjustments that results in the movement of Met1775 to fill the specificity pocket, explaining the loss of peptide binding specificity and transcriptional activity associated with this variant. Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that lead to amino acid substitutions are likely to have diverse phenotypic consequences and implications for human disease. Although computational methods have been proposed to assess the effect of individual SNPs (52), relatively little has been done at the experimental level to provide insight into the effects of SNPs. The database of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations provides an important first look at the kind of genetic diversity that exists in the human population. Another example of a large mutation database is that assembled for mutations found in p53 from human tumors. Detailed studies of the stability of the p53 DNA binding domain indicate that, like the BRCA1 BRCT domain, this relatively unstable domain is sensitive to mutations that destabilize the protein fold in addition to other classes of mutations that do not significantly affect protein fold stability but instead modify DNA-binding or proteinprotein interaction surfaces (53). Thus, rapid, general assays of protein structure and function such as the proteolysis assay used here could potentially prove useful for the rapid, high-throughput assessment of the effect of SNPs on protein function. Ultimately, unambiguous classification of variants, as proposed by the IARC Unclassified Genetic variants Working Group (41), will need a comprehensive integrative model to incorporate data from several sources. Robust integrative models have been proposed but they still lack a coherent framework to incorporate functional data. A major roadblock in the development of such a model was the lack of an established series of functional assays with standardized controls, validated against available genetic data. The present study fills this gap and allows for the development of better predictive models. Although a systematic large-scale classification of all BRCA1 variants into the IARC classes has not yet been done, it is expected that a large number will fall into class 3 (uncertain), due to the lack of genetic-based data. Conceivably, even large-scale efforts may not be able to gather sufficient genetic data on individual variants because most are extremely rare. Thus, we anticipate that the use of structural and functional information will be instrumental to move variants from the class 3 into classes that provide a basis for better risk assessment and clinical decisions. In addition, the fact that variants can now also be functionally and structurally rationalized will provide an impulse for further functional dissection of the tumor-suppressive activities of BRCA1.\n",

       "            &lt;td class=&quot;fillremaining&quot; title=&quot;Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of hamartomas in a variety of organs and tissues, including the brain, skin, and kidneys [Roach et al., 1999]. Mutations in either the TSC1 gene on chromosome 9q34 (MIM# 605284) [van Slegtenhorst et al., 1997], or the TSC2 gene on chromosome 16p13.3 (MIM# 191092) [European Consortium, 1993] cause TSC. In 75â€“85% of TSC cases, a definite germ-line TSC1 or TSC2 mutation is identified, whereas in another 5â€“10% of cases, it is not absolutely clear from the genetic data whether the change is pathogenic or a neutral variant [Sancak et al., 2005].The TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2), interact to form a protein complex [van Slegtenhorst et al., 1998]. TSC1 is important for maintaining the stability, activity, and correct intracellular localization of the TSC1â€“TSC2 complex [Benvenuto et al., 2000; Cai et al., 2006; Chong-Kopera et al., 2006]. The N-terminal region of TSC2 (amino acids 1â€“900) mediates the interaction with TSC1 [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011; Nellist et al., 2001], while amino acids 1,525â€“1,770 in the C-terminal region of TSC2 form an â€œasparagine-thumbâ€� GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain [Daumke et al. 2004]. The TSC1â€“TSC2 complex acts on the GTPase Ras homologue expressed in brain (RHEB) to inhibit RHEBâ€“GTP-dependent stimulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (TORC1) [Huang and Manning, 2008]. In TSC-associated lesions, loss or inactivation of the TSC1â€“TSC2 complex results in TORC1 activation and the constitutive phosphorylation of the downstream TORC1 targets including p70 S6 kinase (S6K), ribosomal protein S6 and 4E-BP1 [Huang and Manning, 2008]. To determine whether unclassified TSC1 and TSC2 variants are disease-causing, the effect of the changes on TSC1â€“TSC2 complex formation, on the activation of RHEB GTPase activity by the complex, and on the phosphorylation status of S6K, S6, and 4E-BP1 can be determined [Dunlop et al., 2011; Hodges et al., 2001; Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011; Inoki et al., 2002; Rendtorff et al., 2005; Qin et al., 2001].Previously, we compared 107 TSC2 variants using a standardized immunoblot assay to estimate the effects of nonterminating changes on TSC2 stability, the TSC1â€“TSC2 interaction and/or the role of the TSC1â€“TSC2 complex in the regulation of TORC1 signaling [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011]. Here, we assess another 78 TSC2 variants, identified during mutation screening of individuals suspected of having TSC.Materials and MethodsTSC2 VariantsTSC2 variants for testing were identified during mutation screening of individuals suspected of having TSC. The variants were compared to wild-type TSC2 (GenBank X75621; GI:450351; NM_000548.3) and to the pathogenic TSC2 p.R611Q variant [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011]. The variants are listed in Supp. Table S1. The available clinical and family data on the individuals carrying the variants are summarized in Supp. Table S2.Nucleotide numbering reflects the cDNA numbering with +1 corresponding to the A of the ATG translation initiation codon in the reference sequence, according to journal guidelines (www.hgvs.org/mutnomen). The initiation codon is codon 1.Constructs and AntiseraExpression constructs encoding the variants were derived from the wild-type TSC2 expression construct by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), as described previously [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011]. In each case, the complete open reading frame of the mutated construct was verified by sequence analysis. DNA was prepared using the Plasmid Plus Midi Purification kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). In some cases, multiple clones were isolated, verified and used for the assays described below. It is important to note that the TSC2 wild-type lacks the amino acids encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 31. The amino acid numbering according to the TSC2 Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD) (http://www.lovd.nl/TSC2), where this differs from the original numbering due to the inclusion of exon 31, is given in Supp. Table S1. Other constructs used in this study have been described previously [Nellist et al., 2005]. Both the wild-type TSC1 (GenBank AF013168.1; GI: 2331280) [van Slegtenhorst et al., 1998] and S6K (2B4) expression constructs encode C-terminal myc-epitope tags.Antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA) (1A5, anti-T389 phospho-S6K mouse monoclonal; anti-myc tag rabbit polyclonal), Li-Cor Biosciences (Lincoln, NE) (goat anti-rabbit 680 nm and goat anti-mouse 800 nm conjugates), or Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA) (3G9D9, anti-TSC2 mouse monoclonal). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against human TSC2 and TSC1 have been described previously [van Slegtenhorst et al., 1998].Immunoblot Assay for Functional Assessment of TSC2 VariantsThe transfection-based immunoblot assay for the functional assessment of the TSC2 variants was performed as described previously [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011]. We compared each variant to wild-type TSC2 and the pathogenic TSC2 p.R611Q variant in at least four independent transfection experiments. HEK 293T cells were seeded into 24-well plates and grown overnight in Dulbecco&amp;#39;s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 Î¼g/ml streptomycin in a 10% carbon dioxide humidified incubator. Cells at 80â€“90% confluency were transfected with 0.2 Î¼g TSC2 expression construct, 0.4 Î¼g TSC1 expression construct, and 0.1 Î¼g S6K expression construct using 2.1 Î¼g polyethyleneimine (PEI) (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) in DMEM, as described previously [Coevoets et al., 2009]. Cells transfected with expression constructs encoding the TSC2 variants, TSC1, and S6K were compared to cells transfected with wild-type TSC2, TSC1, and S6K, with a known pathogenic variant (TSC2-R611Q [Nellist et al., 2005]), TSC1 and S6K, with TSC1 and S6K only (no TSC2), and cells transfected with vector DNA only (control). For control transfections, pcDNA3 vector DNA was added to make a total of 0.7 Î¼g DNA per transfection. In each experiment, the expression constructs were mixed prior to the addition of PEI, and after a 15 min incubation the DNAâ€“PEI complexes were added to the cells.After 4 hr, the transfection mixtures were replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. Twenty-four hours after transfection the cells were transferred to ice, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (4Â°C) and harvested in 75 Î¼l lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, and 1% Triton X100, containing a protease inhibitor cocktail [Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Woerden, The Netherlands]). After centrifugation (10,000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C), the supernatant fractions were recovered, diluted in loading buffer and incubated at 96Â°C for 5 min prior to electrophoresis on CriterionTM 4â€“12% SDS-PAGE gradient gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to the manufacturer&amp;#39;s recommendations.Blots were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature with 5% low-fat milk powder (Campina Melkunie, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) in PBS and incubated overnight at 4Â°C with the following primary antibodies: 1/15,000 dilution of 1895 (rabbit polyclonal against TSC2 [van Slegtenhorst et al., 1998]), 1/5,000 dilution of 2,197 (rabbit polyclonal against TSC1 [van Slegtenhorst et al., 1998]), 1/5,000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal against the myc epitope tag and 1/2,000 dilution of 1A5 (mouse monoclonal against S6K phosphorylated at amino acid T389). Antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich Fine Chemicals, Poole, UK). After washing three times for 5 min in PBST, the blots were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature in the dark in PBST containing 1/10,000 dilutions of goat anti-rabbit 680 nm and goat anti-mouse 800 nm secondary antibodies. After washing three times for 5 min in PBST and once in PBS, the blots were scanned using the OdysseyTM Infrared Imager (Li-Cor Biosciences) at default intensity, medium quality, 169 Î¼m resolution with 0 mm focus offset. To estimate the expression levels of the different proteins and the ratio of T389-phosphorylated S6K to total S6K, in the presence of the different TSC2 variants, the scans were analyzed using the Odyssey quantification software. The integrated intensities of the protein bands were determined using default settings with the 3 pixel width border mean average background correction method.Prediction AnalysisTo assess whether the TSC2 nucleotide changes might affect splicing, four prediction algorithms within the ALAMUT software package (ALAMUT version 2.0; Interactive Biosoftware, Rouen, France) were compared. To assess the likely effects of the amino acid changes on the TSC2 protein, the Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) algorithm [Ng and Henikoff, 2006] was utilized, as before [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011]. To determine whether any of the variants had been identified in a control population where individuals were not selected according to a (suspected) diagnosis of TSC, we searched the exome variant server (EVS) from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/).ResultsFunctional AssessmentIn total, we assessed 78 different TSC2 variants, including 73 missense changes, one change affecting the initiation codon (pM1?), two small in-frame deletions (p.V241del and p.E1552del), and one frameshift mutation (p.L1750Afs25). In two cases, p.E75G/p.P670L and p.V1144L/p.H1773P, we assessed the effect of multiple TSC2 amino acid substitutions on TSC1â€“TSC2 function.To investigate whether the variants affected the activity of the TSC1â€“TSC2 complex, we used a standardized immunoblot assay [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011]. We compared the variants to wild-type TSC2 and the pathogenic TSC2 p.R611Q variant in at least four independent transfection experiments. In each experiment, separate expression constructs encoding the TSC2 variant, TSC1, and S6K were cotransfected into HEK 293T cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were harvested, lysed, and subjected to immunoblotting to assess TSC2, TSC1, and S6K expression, and S6K-T389 phosphorylation. The integrated intensities of the bands on the immunoblots corresponding to TSC2, TSC1, total S6K, and T389-phosphorylated S6K (T389) were determined for each variant, relative to the signals for the wild-type TSC1â€“TSC2 complex. The mean values for the TSC2, TSC1, and S6K signals, and the mean ratios of T389-phosphorylated S6K to total S6K (T389/S6K ratio) are shown in Figure 1. Examples of the immunoblot experiments are shown in Figure 2.Figure 1. Figure 1. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slideFunctional assessment of the TSC2 variants. The signals for TSC2, TSC1, total S6K (S6K), and T389-phosphorylated S6K (T389) were determined per variant, relative to the wild-type control (TSC2) in at least four independent transfection experiments. The mean TSC2 (A; blue), TSC1 (B; green) and S6K (D; magenta) signals and mean T389/S6K ratio (C; purple) are shown for each variant. In each case, the dotted line indicates the signal/ratio for wild-type TSC2 (= 1.0).

Cells co-expressing the TSC2 variants, TSC1 and S6K were compared to cells co-expressing wild-type TSC2 (TSC2), TSC1 and S6K, and cells coexpressing the pathogenic TSC2 p.R611Q (R611Q) and p.N1643S (N1643S) variants, TSC1 and S6K. Control cells expressing TSC1 and S6K only (TSC1/S6K), and cells transfected with vector only (mock) were also included in the transfection experiments and on the blots. Variant amino acid changes are given according to the TSC2 Leiden Open Variation Database (TSC2 cDNA reference transcript sequence NM_000548.3; http://www.lovd.nl/TSC2), and different examples of the blots from separate transfection experiments probed with antibodies specific for TSC2, TSC1, total S6K (S6K) and T389-phosphorylated S6K (T389) are shown. Note the variation in the signals for the TSC2 p.L493V variant in A, B and C; the slight shift of the TSC2 p.M1? variant in C; and the very low signal for the TSC2 p.L1750Afs25 variant in D and E.A S6K reporter construct was cotransfected with the TSC2 variant expression constructs. Therefore, to determine whether the transfection efficiencies for the different variants were approximately equal, the total S6K signals were compared to the total S6K signal for wild-type TSC1â€“TSC2. The mean total S6K signals were significantly different from the control value (P &amp;lt; 0.05; Student&amp;#39;s t-test) in only two cases, p.S1379L and p.L1584R (Supp. Table S1; Fig. 1D). For the p.S1379L variant, the total S6K signal was significantly lower than the wild-type control; and for the p.L1584R variant, the total S6K signal was significantly higher than the control.Next, we compared the mean signals for the different TSC2 variants to the wild-type TSC2 signal (Supp. Table S1; Fig. 1A). None of the variants gave signals that were significantly higher than the wild-type control, whereas the signals for 19 (24% of total) variants were significantly lower than the wild-type (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Of these, 10 (53%) map to the N-terminal half of TSC2, between amino acids 1 and 889, and 7 (37%) map between amino acids 1,552 and 1,675, within the TSC2 GAP domain (amino acids 1,525â€“1,770).The mean TSC1 signals in the presence of the different TSC2 variants were compared (Fig. 1B). None of the variants gave TSC1 signals that were significantly higher than the wild-type TSC1â€“TSC2 control signals, but in 23 cases (29% of total), the TSC1 signals were significantly reduced (Supp. Table S1; Fig. 1B). Of these, 18 (78%) variants map to the N-terminal half of TSC2, between amino acids 75 and 889, and four (17%) map to the TSC2 GAP domain, between amino acids 1552 and 1653.In 14 cases (18% of total), both the TSC1 and TSC2 signals were significantly reduced compared to the wild-type control (Supp. Table S1; Fig. 1A and B). Of these, nine variants (64%) map to the N-terminal half of TSC2, between amino acids 241 and 889, and four (29%) map to the TSC2 GAP domain, between amino acids 1,552 and 1,653.The T389/S6K ratio provides an estimate for the kinase activity of TORC1. The higher the ratio, the higher the activity of TORC1. We compared the T389/S6K ratios in the presence of the TSC2 variants, to the ratios in the presence of wild-type TSC2 and the pathogenic TSC2 p.R611Q variant (Supp. Table S1; Fig. 1C). For 38 variants (49%), the mean T389/S6K ratio was not significantly different to the mean T389/S6K ratio in the presence of wild-type TSC2 (P &amp;gt; 0.05). Importantly, in each of these cases, the mean T389/S6K ratio was significantly lower (P &amp;lt; 0.05) than the mean T389/S6K ratio in the presence of the TSC2 p.R611Q variant, indicating that these variants were more effective at inhibiting TORC1 than the pathogenic p.R611Q variant.For the remaining 40 variants (51%), the mean T389/S6K ratio was significantly higher than in the presence of wild-type TSC2, indicating that TORC1 was inhibited less effectively in the presence of these variants. For 29 of these variants, the T389/S6K ratio was not significantly different from the ratio in the presence of the p.R611Q variant. In five cases (p.V241del, p.A889P, p.T1203K, p.G1567D, and p.V1673D), the ratio was significantly increased compared to both wild-type TSC2 and the p.R611Q variant. Finally, in six cases (p.I427M, p.R462C, p.L493V, p.R505Q, p.Y598C, and p.Q1554H), the T389/S6K ratio had an intermediate value, significantly higher than wild-type TSC2, but significantly lower than the p.R611Q variant.Prediction AnalysisTo predict whether any of the 73 amino acid substitutions studied were likely to affect TSC2 structure and/or function we used the SIFT algorithm [Ng and Henikoff, 2006], as described previously [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011]. As shown in Figure 3 and Supp. Table S1, 28 of the 73 substitutions (38%) were predicted to be tolerated (T) and 45 (62%) were predicted not to be tolerated (NT). Of the variants predicted not to be tolerated, 33 (73%) had a T389/S6K ratio that was significantly increased compared to the wild type, whereas 25 (89%) of the variants predicted to be tolerated had a T389/S6K ratio that was not significantly different to that for wild-type TSC2. Therefore, in 15 cases (21%) there was a discrepancy between the SIFT prediction and our functional assessment.Figure 3. Figure 3. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slideOverview of the functional assessment of the TSC2 variants. The positions of the TSC2 variants analyzed as part of this study are indicated relative to the coding exons of the TSC2 gene and are numbered according to the TSC2 LOVD (http://www.lovd.nl/TSC2). Amino acid substitutions listed above the exons were not tolerated (NT) by the SIFT algorithm; substitutions listed below the exons were tolerated (T) by SIFT; variants for which SIFT did not make a prediction are indicated with square brakets above the exons. Variants classified as pathogenic are indicated in red; variants classified as probably pathogenic are indicated in orange; variants classified as possibly pathogenic are indicated in purple; variants classified as unlikely to be pathogenic are indicated in blue; variants classified as probably neutral are indicated in green. Variants for which there was strong disagreeement between our assay and the SIFT prediction are underlined. A: TSC2 variants mapping to TSC2 exons 1â€“23 (amino acids 1â€“900). B: TSC2 variants mapping to TSC2 exons 23â€“41 (amino acids 901â€“1807). The location of the TSC2 GAP domain is indicated by gray shading.To investigate potential effects on splicing, we performed splice site prediction analysis using the ALAMUT software package. We only identified one substitution, TSC2 c.4662G&amp;gt;C (p.Q1554H), involving the last base of exon 35, that was predicted to disrupt the normal splice acceptor site.Finally, we searched the EVS from the NHLBI exome sequencing project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/) to determine whether any of the variants tested had been identified in a control population, not selected according to a (suspected) diagnosis of TSC. In total, 10 of the variants from our study were listed in the EVS (Supp. Table S1). In nine cases (90%), the variants had a T389/S6K ratio that was not significantly different from wild-type TSC2. In the remaining case, TSC2 c.1514G&amp;gt;A (p.R505Q), the variant was associated with an intermediate T389/S6K ratio, significantly higher than wild-type TSC2, but significantly lower than the p.R611Q pathogenic variant (see the section â€œDiscussionâ€�).DiscussionWe investigated the effects of 78 TSC2 nucleotide variants on TSC1â€“TSC2 function. The results of our functional assessment are shown in Figure 1 and Supp. Table S1 and have been submitted to the TSC2 LOVD (http://www.lovd.nl/TSC2). We identified 40 variants that resulted in reduced TSC1â€“TSC2-dependent inhibition of TORC1 activity, as estimated by significant increases in the observed T389/S6K ratios (Supp. Table S1; Fig. 1C). In 34 (85%) of these cases, the T389/S6K ratios were either not significantly different, or were significantly increased compared to the TSC2 p.R611Q pathogenic variant. We classified these changes as pathogenic, with one exception. The total S6K values for the TSC2 p.L1584R variant were significantly higher than the wild-type control values, suggesting that the transfection efficiency for this variant may not be comparable to the wild-type control even though the TSC2 and TSC1 signals were not significantly different from the corresponding wild-type signals. Therefore, we classified this variant as only probably pathogenic.Of the 40 variants with significantly increased T389/S6K ratios, the TSC2 signals were significantly reduced compared to the wild-type control in 19 cases (48%) (Supp. Table S1; compare Fig. 1A and C). The most straightforward explanation for the observed reductions in the TSC2 signals is that the corresponding amino acid changes destabilize TSC2, leading to accelerated degradation of the variants, compared to wild-type TSC2. Although it is possible that contaminants in the plasmid DNA preparations could have affected the transfection efficiency of some variants, we think that this is unlikely. We observed significantly reduced TSC2 signals across multiple plasmid preparations of several different variants. Furthermore, the TSC2 variant expression constructs were cotransfected with TSC1 and S6K expression constructs. Any contaminants in the TSC2 variant preparation should, therefore, also affect the transfection efficiency of the S6K expression construct. This was not the case. For 76/78 (97%) of the variants, the S6K signal was not significantly different to the wild-type TSC1â€“TSC2 control.The TSC1â€“TSC2 interaction is required for stabilization of both TSC1 and TSC2 [Benvenuto et al., 2000; Chong-Kopera et al., 2006; Nellist et al., 1999]. Indeed, for 14 (74%) of the 19 variants with significantly reduced TSC2 signals, the TSC1 signals were significantly reduced relative to the wild-type TSC1 signal. Nine (64%) of the variants showing reduced TSC1 and TSC2 signals map to the N-terminal half of TSC2, between amino acids 241 and 889 (Fig. 1A and B), that is critical for maintaining the TSC1â€“TSC2 interaction [Nellist et al., 2001]. In addition, four variants map between amino acids 1,552 and 1,653, within the TSC2 GAP domain (amino acids 1,525â€“1,770) that is critical for TSC1â€“TSC2 activity [Daumke et al., 2004]. This suggests that in addition to its critical GAP function, the GAP domain is also vital for TSC2 (and hence TSC1) stability. The only amino acid change that resulted in reduced TSC2 and TSC1 signals and mapped outside these two regions was the p.T1203K substitution. This variant maps very close to p.R1200W, another unstable, pathogenic TSC2 variant [Wentink et al., 2012], indicating that this region is also important for TSC1â€“TSC2 stability.In five cases, p.M1?, p.Y1571N, p.T1623I, p.P1675L, and p.L1750Afs25, the TSC2 signal was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type TSC1â€“TSC2 control, whereas the TSC1 signal was not. In these cases, it is most likely that the changes affect TSC2 expression and/or stability, but not sufficiently to result in reductions in the TSC1 signals. The p.M1? variant migrated marginally ahead of wild-type TSC2 and the other variants (Fig. 2C) probably because another, downstream ATG is utilized as the initiating codon. The next ATG is at codon 50, and the sequence surrounding this codon corresponds quite well with the consensus Kozak sequence. Therefore, on the assumption that the p.M1? variant lacks the N-terminal 49 amino acids, our results indicate that this region is more important for TSC2 stability than for the TSC1â€“TSC2 interaction. In the case of the p.L1750Afs25 variant, the reduced signal was because epitopes recognized by our antiserum are disrupted by the frameshift mutation. Expression of the p.L1750Afs25 variant was confirmed with an antibody raised against other TSC2 epitopes (anti-TSC2 mouse monoclonal clone 3G9D9, Zymed Laboratories; data not shown).In nine cases, the TSC1 signal was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type control, even though the TSC2 signal was not significantly affected by the corresponding amino acid change. These variants mapped between amino acids 75 and 844 in the N-terminal region of TSC2 that is essential for the interaction with TSC1 [Nellist et al., 2001] (Supp. Table S1; Fig 1A and B). It is most likely that these changes cause conformational changes that disrupt TSC1 binding as well as TSC1â€“TSC2 RHEB GAP activity, without severely affecting TSC2 stability.Six variants (p.I427M, p.R462C, p.L493V, p.R505Q, p.Y598C, and p.Q1554H) had an intermediate effect on the T389/S6K ratios in our assay. The ratios were significantly increased compared to wild-type TSC2 (mean T389/S6K ratio 1.00) and significantly decreased with respect to the p.R611Q variant (mean T389/S6K ratio 3.72).In addition to an intermediate effect on TORC1 activity, the p.R462C (mean T389/S6K ratio 2.35) and p.Y598C (mean T389/S6K ratio 2.00) variants were associated with clearly reduced TSC1 signals, indicating that these amino acid substitutions interfere with TSC1â€“TSC2 binding, similar to other substitutions at the same codons (p.R462H, p.R462P and p.Y598H [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011]). Therefore, because the T389/S6K ratios were significantly increased relative to wild-type TSC2 and because the TSC1 signals were significantly decreased, we concluded that the p.R462C and p.Y598C changes are probably pathogenic. Both variants were identified in individuals who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for TSC and neither amino acid substitution was tolerated according to the SIFT analysis (Supp. Table S1).The TSC2 p.Q1554H variant also had an intermediate effect on the TSC1â€“TSC2-dependent inhibition of TORC1 (mean T389/S6K ratio 2.09) in our assay, and no significant effects on the TSC1 or TSC2 signals were detected. The TSC2 c.4662G&amp;gt;C (p.Q1554H) nucleotide change was predicted by ALAMUT to disrupt the normal splice acceptor site. Therefore, in addition to the effect of the p.Q1554H substitution on TSC1â€“TSC2 activity it is also possible that the TSC2 c.4662G&amp;gt;C substitution affects splicing of the TSC2 mRNA, resulting in lower levels of the TSC2 p.Q1554H variant protein in vivo. We concluded that the TSC2 c.4662G&amp;gt;C (p.Q1554H) variant was probably a pathogenic mutation, consistent with a previous report on the TSC2 c.4662G&amp;gt;T (p.Q1554H) variant (Rendtorff et al., 2005). Unfortunately, no clinical information was available for the individual carrying the TSC2 c.4662G&amp;gt;C (p.Q1554H) variant.Compared to wild-type TSC2, no significant differences in the TSC1 or TSC2 signals for the p.I427M, p.L493V, and p.R505Q variants were observed, even though all three variants map to the region of TSC2 that is important for TSC1 binding and stabilization. Nonetheless, the T389/S6K ratios were consistently and significantly raised, relative to the wild type. The mean T389/S6K ratios were 1.39, 1.91, and 1.85, respectively, compared to a T389/S6K ratio of 1.00 for wild-type TSC2 and 3.72 for the pathogenic p.R611Q variant (Fig. 1C).The p.I427M variant was identified in an adult with facial angiofibroma, subependymal nodules, and epilepsy. No information on other family members was available. SIFT predicted that the amino acid change would not be tolerated (NT), even though both isoleucine and methionine are hydrophobic amino acids. No potential effects on splicing were identified. We concluded that our assay did not provide conclusive evidence regarding the pathogenicity of this variant. Therefore, we classified the TSC2 c.1281C&amp;gt;G (p.I427M) variant as possibly pathogenic. No clinical information was available for the individual carrying the TSC2 c.1477C&amp;gt;G (p.L493V) variant [Langkau et al., 2002]. Although leucine and valine are very similar amino acids, the p.L493V substitution was classified as not tolerated by SIFT. Therefore, we also classified this variant as possibly pathogenic. The R505Q variant was originally identified in a family that did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for TSC and was shown to have reduced activity relative to wild-type TSC2 [Dunlop et al., 2011]. The variant has also been identified once in a control population of 10 758 individuals not selected according to their TSC status (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/). Our functional data are consistent with those of Dunlop et al., and with the suggestion that the variant may contribute to TSC pathogenicity. Therefore, we classified this variant as possibly pathogenic.The remaining 38 changes (49%) were indistinguishable from wild-type TSC2 in our assays, and we concluded, with one exception (TSC2 c.4136C&amp;gt;T [p.S1379L]; see below), that these are all most likely to be rare, neutral amino acid substitutions. In nine cases, the variant was also identified in a control population (see Supp. Table S1 and http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/).In one case, TSC2 c.4136C&amp;gt;T (p.S1379L), the S6K signals were significantly reduced compared to the control values, suggesting that the transfection efficiencies were lower. Therefore, although the values for the TSC2 and TSC1 signals for the variant were not significantly different from the control values, our functional assessment of this variant might not be completely reliable. Nonetheless, as the T389/S6K ratio was not significantly different from the wild-type control (Fig. 2C), we classified the TSC2 c.4136C&amp;gt;T (p.S1379L) variant as unlikely to be pathogenic. The p.S1379L amino acid substitution was tolerated according to the SIFT analysis, and maps between amino acids 1,203 and 1,496. None of the variants that map to this region and have been tested in our assay affect TSC1â€“TSC2 function (this study and Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011).Forty-five of the amino acid substitutions analyzed as part of this study were predicted by SIFT to be not tolerated (NT). We classified 26 (58%) of these as pathogenic, four (9%) as probably pathogenic and three (7%) as possibly pathogenic. In 12 (27%) cases, we classified changes as probably neutral and therefore discordant with the SIFT prediction. Of the 28 changes that were tolerated (T) according to SIFT, 24 (89%) did not affect TSC2 function in our assay. We classified three (11%) as pathogenic and therefore discordant with the SIFT prediction. Overall, our functional assessment was discordant with the SIFT prediction in 15 cases (21%), in line with previous reports [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011].We assessed the effects of 78 TSC2 variants on TSC1â€“TSC2 function and classified the variants into seven different groups according to their stability, their affect on TSC1 stability, their affect on TORC1 activity, and the results of the SIFT analysis. The results of our classification are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 3. Although, in most cases, the clinical and family data on the individuals with the variants were limited (Supp. Table S2), there was only one variant, c.2753C&amp;gt;G (p.S918C), where there was a strong disagreement between our functional assessment and the available clinical and family data.Table 1. Classification of TSC2 VariantsGroup\tSIFT\tTSC2 signal\tTSC1 signal\tT389/S6K ratio\tTSC2 variantsVariants were divided into groups according to the results of the transfection-based immunoblot assay and to whether the changes were predicted to be tolerated (T) or not to be tolerated (NT) by SIFT analysis [Ng and Henikoff, 2006]. Variants showing significantly reduced signals compared to wild-type TSC2 and variants for which the TSC1 signal was significantly reduced are indicated as â€œreduced.â€� For each variant, the ratio of T389-phosphorylated to total S6K was determined (T389/S6K ratio). Variants for which the T389/S6K ratios were significantly higher than wild-type TSC2 are indicated as â€œincreased.â€� This corresponds to increased TORC1 activity, due to reduced TSC1â€“TSC2 function. We identified seven groups of variants. All the variants in groups 1, 3, and 5 were classified as pathogenic; the variants in groups 2 and 4 were classified as either pathogenic, probably pathogenic (indicated with 1.), or possibly pathogenic (indicated with 2.); variants in groups 6 and 7 were classified as probably neutral or unlikely to be pathogenic (indicated with 3.). Variants for which SIFT did not provide a prediction are indicated with 4..

Changes to the TSC2 C-terminal region were more likely to disrupt the TSC1â€“TSC2-dependent inhibition of TORC1, without affecting TSC1 levels. However, according to our assessment, amino acid changes mapping within the TSC2 GAP domain can also affect TSC1â€“TSC2 stability. In five cases, TSC2 missense variants had an intermediate effect on TSC1â€“TSC2 activty, consistent with a previous report [Dunlop et al., 2011], and confirming the importance of considering the clinical, genetic, and functional data before a decision is made regarding the pathogenicity of any particular variant.&quot;&gt;\n",
       "                Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of hamartomas in a variety of organs and tissues, including the brain, skin, and kidneys [Roach et al., 1999]. Mutations in either the TSC1 gene on chromosome 9q34 (MIM# 605284) [van Slegtenhorst et al., 1997], or the TSC2 gene on chromosome 16p13.3 (MIM# 191092) [European Consortium, 1993] cause TSC. In 75â€“85% of TSC cases, a definite germ-line TSC1 or TSC2 mutation is identified, whereas in another 5â€“10% of cases, it is not absolutely clear from the genetic data whether the change is pathogenic or a neutral variant [Sancak et al., 2005].The TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2), interact to form a protein complex [van Slegtenhorst et al., 1998]. TSC1 is important for maintaining the stability, activity, and correct intracellular localization of the TSC1â€“TSC2 complex [Benvenuto et al., 2000; Cai et al., 2006; Chong-Kopera et al., 2006]. The N-terminal region of TSC2 (amino acids 1â€“900) mediates the interaction with TSC1 [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011; Nellist et al., 2001], while amino acids 1,525â€“1,770 in the C-terminal region of TSC2 form an â€œasparagine-thumbâ€� GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain [Daumke et al. 2004]. The TSC1â€“TSC2 complex acts on the GTPase Ras homologue expressed in brain (RHEB) to inhibit RHEBâ€“GTP-dependent stimulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (TORC1) [Huang and Manning, 2008]. In TSC-associated lesions, loss or inactivation of the TSC1â€“TSC2 complex results in TORC1 activation and the constitutive phosphorylation of the downstream TORC1 targets including p70 S6 kinase (S6K), ribosomal protein S6 and 4E-BP1 [Huang and Manning, 2008]. To determine whether unclassified TSC1 and TSC2 variants are disease-causing, the effect of the changes on TSC1â€“TSC2 complex formation, on the activation of RHEB GTPase activity by the complex, and on the phosphorylation status of S6K, S6, and 4E-BP1 can be determined [Dunlop et al., 2011; Hodges et al., 2001; Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011; Inoki et al., 2002; Rendtorff et al., 2005; Qin et al., 2001].Previously, we compared 107 TSC2 variants using a standardized immunoblot assay to estimate the effects of nonterminating changes on TSC2 stability, the TSC1â€“TSC2 interaction and/or the role of the TSC1â€“TSC2 complex in the regulation of TORC1 signaling [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011]. Here, we assess another 78 TSC2 variants, identified during mutation screening of individuals suspected of having TSC.Materials and MethodsTSC2 VariantsTSC2 variants for testing were identified during mutation screening of individuals suspected of having TSC. The variants were compared to wild-type TSC2 (GenBank X75621; GI:450351; NM_000548.3) and to the pathogenic TSC2 p.R611Q variant [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011]. The variants are listed in Supp. Table S1. The available clinical and family data on the individuals carrying the variants are summarized in Supp. Table S2.Nucleotide numbering reflects the cDNA numbering with +1 corresponding to the A of the ATG translation initiation codon in the reference sequence, according to journal guidelines (www.hgvs.org/mutnomen). The initiation codon is codon 1.Constructs and AntiseraExpression constructs encoding the variants were derived from the wild-type TSC2 expression construct by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), as described previously [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011]. In each case, the complete open reading frame of the mutated construct was verified by sequence analysis. DNA was prepared using the Plasmid Plus Midi Purification kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). In some cases, multiple clones were isolated, verified and used for the assays described below. It is important to note that the TSC2 wild-type lacks the amino acids encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 31. The amino acid numbering according to the TSC2 Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD) (http://www.lovd.nl/TSC2), where this differs from the original numbering due to the inclusion of exon 31, is given in Supp. Table S1. Other constructs used in this study have been described previously [Nellist et al., 2005]. Both the wild-type TSC1 (GenBank AF013168.1; GI: 2331280) [van Slegtenhorst et al., 1998] and S6K (2B4) expression constructs encode C-terminal myc-epitope tags.Antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA) (1A5, anti-T389 phospho-S6K mouse monoclonal; anti-myc tag rabbit polyclonal), Li-Cor Biosciences (Lincoln, NE) (goat anti-rabbit 680 nm and goat anti-mouse 800 nm conjugates), or Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA) (3G9D9, anti-TSC2 mouse monoclonal). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against human TSC2 and TSC1 have been described previously [van Slegtenhorst et al., 1998].Immunoblot Assay for Functional Assessment of TSC2 VariantsThe transfection-based immunoblot assay for the functional assessment of the TSC2 variants was performed as described previously [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011]. We compared each variant to wild-type TSC2 and the pathogenic TSC2 p.R611Q variant in at least four independent transfection experiments. HEK 293T cells were seeded into 24-well plates and grown overnight in Dulbecco&amp;#39;s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 Î¼g/ml streptomycin in a 10% carbon dioxide humidified incubator. Cells at 80â€“90% confluency were transfected with 0.2 Î¼g TSC2 expression construct, 0.4 Î¼g TSC1 expression construct, and 0.1 Î¼g S6K expression construct using 2.1 Î¼g polyethyleneimine (PEI) (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) in DMEM, as described previously [Coevoets et al., 2009]. Cells transfected with expression constructs encoding the TSC2 variants, TSC1, and S6K were compared to cells transfected with wild-type TSC2, TSC1, and S6K, with a known pathogenic variant (TSC2-R611Q [Nellist et al., 2005]), TSC1 and S6K, with TSC1 and S6K only (no TSC2), and cells transfected with vector DNA only (control). For control transfections, pcDNA3 vector DNA was added to make a total of 0.7 Î¼g DNA per transfection. In each experiment, the expression constructs were mixed prior to the addition of PEI, and after a 15 min incubation the DNAâ€“PEI complexes were added to the cells.After 4 hr, the transfection mixtures were replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. Twenty-four hours after transfection the cells were transferred to ice, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (4Â°C) and harvested in 75 Î¼l lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, and 1% Triton X100, containing a protease inhibitor cocktail [Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Woerden, The Netherlands]). After centrifugation (10,000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C), the supernatant fractions were recovered, diluted in loading buffer and incubated at 96Â°C for 5 min prior to electrophoresis on CriterionTM 4â€“12% SDS-PAGE gradient gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to the manufacturer&amp;#39;s recommendations.Blots were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature with 5% low-fat milk powder (Campina Melkunie, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) in PBS and incubated overnight at 4Â°C with the following primary antibodies: 1/15,000 dilution of 1895 (rabbit polyclonal against TSC2 [van Slegtenhorst et al., 1998]), 1/5,000 dilution of 2,197 (rabbit polyclonal against TSC1 [van Slegtenhorst et al., 1998]), 1/5,000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal against the myc epitope tag and 1/2,000 dilution of 1A5 (mouse monoclonal against S6K phosphorylated at amino acid T389). Antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich Fine Chemicals, Poole, UK). After washing three times for 5 min in PBST, the blots were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature in the dark in PBST containing 1/10,000 dilutions of goat anti-rabbit 680 nm and goat anti-mouse 800 nm secondary antibodies. After washing three times for 5 min in PBST and once in PBS, the blots were scanned using the OdysseyTM Infrared Imager (Li-Cor Biosciences) at default intensity, medium quality, 169 Î¼m resolution with 0 mm focus offset. To estimate the expression levels of the different proteins and the ratio of T389-phosphorylated S6K to total S6K, in the presence of the different TSC2 variants, the scans were analyzed using the Odyssey quantification software. The integrated intensities of the protein bands were determined using default settings with the 3 pixel width border mean average background correction method.Prediction AnalysisTo assess whether the TSC2 nucleotide changes might affect splicing, four prediction algorithms within the ALAMUT software package (ALAMUT version 2.0; Interactive Biosoftware, Rouen, France) were compared. To assess the likely effects of the amino acid changes on the TSC2 protein, the Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) algorithm [Ng and Henikoff, 2006] was utilized, as before [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011]. To determine whether any of the variants had been identified in a control population where individuals were not selected according to a (suspected) diagnosis of TSC, we searched the exome variant server (EVS) from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/).ResultsFunctional AssessmentIn total, we assessed 78 different TSC2 variants, including 73 missense changes, one change affecting the initiation codon (pM1?), two small in-frame deletions (p.V241del and p.E1552del), and one frameshift mutation (p.L1750Afs25). In two cases, p.E75G/p.P670L and p.V1144L/p.H1773P, we assessed the effect of multiple TSC2 amino acid substitutions on TSC1â€“TSC2 function.To investigate whether the variants affected the activity of the TSC1â€“TSC2 complex, we used a standardized immunoblot assay [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011]. We compared the variants to wild-type TSC2 and the pathogenic TSC2 p.R611Q variant in at least four independent transfection experiments. In each experiment, separate expression constructs encoding the TSC2 variant, TSC1, and S6K were cotransfected into HEK 293T cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were harvested, lysed, and subjected to immunoblotting to assess TSC2, TSC1, and S6K expression, and S6K-T389 phosphorylation. The integrated intensities of the bands on the immunoblots corresponding to TSC2, TSC1, total S6K, and T389-phosphorylated S6K (T389) were determined for each variant, relative to the signals for the wild-type TSC1â€“TSC2 complex. The mean values for the TSC2, TSC1, and S6K signals, and the mean ratios of T389-phosphorylated S6K to total S6K (T389/S6K ratio) are shown in Figure 1. Examples of the immunoblot experiments are shown in Figure 2.Figure 1. Figure 1. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slideFunctional assessment of the TSC2 variants. The signals for TSC2, TSC1, total S6K (S6K), and T389-phosphorylated S6K (T389) were determined per variant, relative to the wild-type control (TSC2) in at least four independent transfection experiments. The mean TSC2 (A; blue), TSC1 (B; green) and S6K (D; magenta) signals and mean T389/S6K ratio (C; purple) are shown for each variant. In each case, the dotted line indicates the signal/ratio for wild-type TSC2 (= 1.0). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean; variants that were significantly different from the wild-type control (TSC2) are indicated with an asterisk (P &amp;lt; 0.05; Student&amp;#39;s t-test). Amino acid changes are given according to the TSC2 Leiden Open Variation Database (TSC2 cDNA reference transcript sequence NM_000548.3; http://www.lovd.nl/TSC2). Variants mapping within the N-terminal region (amino acids 1â€“900) and GAP domain (amino acids 1525â€“1770) are indicated.

Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slideImmunoblot analysis of TSC2 variants. Cells co-expressing the TSC2 variants, TSC1 and S6K were compared to cells co-expressing wild-type TSC2 (TSC2), TSC1 and S6K, and cells coexpressing the pathogenic TSC2 p.R611Q (R611Q) and p.N1643S (N1643S) variants, TSC1 and S6K. Control cells expressing TSC1 and S6K only (TSC1/S6K), and cells transfected with vector only (mock) were also included in the transfection experiments and on the blots. Variant amino acid changes are given according to the TSC2 Leiden Open Variation Database (TSC2 cDNA reference transcript sequence NM_000548.3; http://www.lovd.nl/TSC2), and different examples of the blots from separate transfection experiments probed with antibodies specific for TSC2, TSC1, total S6K (S6K) and T389-phosphorylated S6K (T389) are shown. Note the variation in the signals for the TSC2 p.L493V variant in A, B and C; the slight shift of the TSC2 p.M1? variant in C; and the very low signal for the TSC2 p.L1750Afs25 variant in D and E.A S6K reporter construct was cotransfected with the TSC2 variant expression constructs. Therefore, to determine whether the transfection efficiencies for the different variants were approximately equal, the total S6K signals were compared to the total S6K signal for wild-type TSC1â€“TSC2. The mean total S6K signals were significantly different from the control value (P &amp;lt; 0.05; Student&amp;#39;s t-test) in only two cases, p.S1379L and p.L1584R (Supp. Table S1; Fig. 1D). For the p.S1379L variant, the total S6K signal was significantly lower than the wild-type control; and for the p.L1584R variant, the total S6K signal was significantly higher than the control.Next, we compared the mean signals for the different TSC2 variants to the wild-type TSC2 signal (Supp. Table S1; Fig. 1A). None of the variants gave signals that were significantly higher than the wild-type control, whereas the signals for 19 (24% of total) variants were significantly lower than the wild-type (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Of these, 10 (53%) map to the N-terminal half of TSC2, between amino acids 1 and 889, and 7 (37%) map between amino acids 1,552 and 1,675, within the TSC2 GAP domain (amino acids 1,525â€“1,770).The mean TSC1 signals in the presence of the different TSC2 variants were compared (Fig. 1B). None of the variants gave TSC1 signals that were significantly higher than the wild-type TSC1â€“TSC2 control signals, but in 23 cases (29% of total), the TSC1 signals were significantly reduced (Supp. Table S1; Fig. 1B). Of these, 18 (78%) variants map to the N-terminal half of TSC2, between amino acids 75 and 889, and four (17%) map to the TSC2 GAP domain, between amino acids 1552 and 1653.In 14 cases (18% of total), both the TSC1 and TSC2 signals were significantly reduced compared to the wild-type control (Supp. Table S1; Fig. 1A and B). Of these, nine variants (64%) map to the N-terminal half of TSC2, between amino acids 241 and 889, and four (29%) map to the TSC2 GAP domain, between amino acids 1,552 and 1,653.The T389/S6K ratio provides an estimate for the kinase activity of TORC1. The higher the ratio, the higher the activity of TORC1. We compared the T389/S6K ratios in the presence of the TSC2 variants, to the ratios in the presence of wild-type TSC2 and the pathogenic TSC2 p.R611Q variant (Supp. Table S1; Fig. 1C). For 38 variants (49%), the mean T389/S6K ratio was not significantly different to the mean T389/S6K ratio in the presence of wild-type TSC2 (P &amp;gt; 0.05). Importantly, in each of these cases, the mean T389/S6K ratio was significantly lower (P &amp;lt; 0.05) than the mean T389/S6K ratio in the presence of the TSC2 p.R611Q variant, indicating that these variants were more effective at inhibiting TORC1 than the pathogenic p.R611Q variant.For the remaining 40 variants (51%), the mean T389/S6K ratio was significantly higher than in the presence of wild-type TSC2, indicating that TORC1 was inhibited less effectively in the presence of these variants. For 29 of these variants, the T389/S6K ratio was not significantly different from the ratio in the presence of the p.R611Q variant. In five cases (p.V241del, p.A889P, p.T1203K, p.G1567D, and p.V1673D), the ratio was significantly increased compared to both wild-type TSC2 and the p.R611Q variant. Finally, in six cases (p.I427M, p.R462C, p.L493V, p.R505Q, p.Y598C, and p.Q1554H), the T389/S6K ratio had an intermediate value, significantly higher than wild-type TSC2, but significantly lower than the p.R611Q variant.Prediction AnalysisTo predict whether any of the 73 amino acid substitutions studied were likely to affect TSC2 structure and/or function we used the SIFT algorithm [Ng and Henikoff, 2006], as described previously [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011]. As shown in Figure 3 and Supp. Table S1, 28 of the 73 substitutions (38%) were predicted to be tolerated (T) and 45 (62%) were predicted not to be tolerated (NT). Of the variants predicted not to be tolerated, 33 (73%) had a T389/S6K ratio that was significantly increased compared to the wild type, whereas 25 (89%) of the variants predicted to be tolerated had a T389/S6K ratio that was not significantly different to that for wild-type TSC2. Therefore, in 15 cases (21%) there was a discrepancy between the SIFT prediction and our functional assessment.Figure 3. Figure 3. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slideOverview of the functional assessment of the TSC2 variants. The positions of the TSC2 variants analyzed as part of this study are indicated relative to the coding exons of the TSC2 gene and are numbered according to the TSC2 LOVD (http://www.lovd.nl/TSC2). Amino acid substitutions listed above the exons were not tolerated (NT) by the SIFT algorithm; substitutions listed below the exons were tolerated (T) by SIFT; variants for which SIFT did not make a prediction are indicated with square brakets above the exons. Variants classified as pathogenic are indicated in red; variants classified as probably pathogenic are indicated in orange; variants classified as possibly pathogenic are indicated in purple; variants classified as unlikely to be pathogenic are indicated in blue; variants classified as probably neutral are indicated in green. Variants for which there was strong disagreeement between our assay and the SIFT prediction are underlined. A: TSC2 variants mapping to TSC2 exons 1â€“23 (amino acids 1â€“900). B: TSC2 variants mapping to TSC2 exons 23â€“41 (amino acids 901â€“1807). The location of the TSC2 GAP domain is indicated by gray shading.To investigate potential effects on splicing, we performed splice site prediction analysis using the ALAMUT software package. We only identified one substitution, TSC2 c.4662G&amp;gt;C (p.Q1554H), involving the last base of exon 35, that was predicted to disrupt the normal splice acceptor site.Finally, we searched the EVS from the NHLBI exome sequencing project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/) to determine whether any of the variants tested had been identified in a control population, not selected according to a (suspected) diagnosis of TSC. In total, 10 of the variants from our study were listed in the EVS (Supp. Table S1). In nine cases (90%), the variants had a T389/S6K ratio that was not significantly different from wild-type TSC2. In the remaining case, TSC2 c.1514G&amp;gt;A (p.R505Q), the variant was associated with an intermediate T389/S6K ratio, significantly higher than wild-type TSC2, but significantly lower than the p.R611Q pathogenic variant (see the section â€œDiscussionâ€�).DiscussionWe investigated the effects of 78 TSC2 nucleotide variants on TSC1â€“TSC2 function. The results of our functional assessment are shown in Figure 1 and Supp. Table S1 and have been submitted to the TSC2 LOVD (http://www.lovd.nl/TSC2). We identified 40 variants that resulted in reduced TSC1â€“TSC2-dependent inhibition of TORC1 activity, as estimated by significant increases in the observed T389/S6K ratios (Supp. Table S1; Fig. 1C). In 34 (85%) of these cases, the T389/S6K ratios were either not significantly different, or were significantly increased compared to the TSC2 p.R611Q pathogenic variant. We classified these changes as pathogenic, with one exception. The total S6K values for the TSC2 p.L1584R variant were significantly higher than the wild-type control values, suggesting that the transfection efficiency for this variant may not be comparable to the wild-type control even though the TSC2 and TSC1 signals were not significantly different from the corresponding wild-type signals. Therefore, we classified this variant as only probably pathogenic.Of the 40 variants with significantly increased T389/S6K ratios, the TSC2 signals were significantly reduced compared to the wild-type control in 19 cases (48%) (Supp. Table S1; compare Fig. 1A and C). The most straightforward explanation for the observed reductions in the TSC2 signals is that the corresponding amino acid changes destabilize TSC2, leading to accelerated degradation of the variants, compared to wild-type TSC2. Although it is possible that contaminants in the plasmid DNA preparations could have affected the transfection efficiency of some variants, we think that this is unlikely. We observed significantly reduced TSC2 signals across multiple plasmid preparations of several different variants. Furthermore, the TSC2 variant expression constructs were cotransfected with TSC1 and S6K expression constructs. Any contaminants in the TSC2 variant preparation should, therefore, also affect the transfection efficiency of the S6K expression construct. This was not the case. For 76/78 (97%) of the variants, the S6K signal was not significantly different to the wild-type TSC1â€“TSC2 control.The TSC1â€“TSC2 interaction is required for stabilization of both TSC1 and TSC2 [Benvenuto et al., 2000; Chong-Kopera et al., 2006; Nellist et al., 1999]. Indeed, for 14 (74%) of the 19 variants with significantly reduced TSC2 signals, the TSC1 signals were significantly reduced relative to the wild-type TSC1 signal. Nine (64%) of the variants showing reduced TSC1 and TSC2 signals map to the N-terminal half of TSC2, between amino acids 241 and 889 (Fig. 1A and B), that is critical for maintaining the TSC1â€“TSC2 interaction [Nellist et al., 2001]. In addition, four variants map between amino acids 1,552 and 1,653, within the TSC2 GAP domain (amino acids 1,525â€“1,770) that is critical for TSC1â€“TSC2 activity [Daumke et al., 2004]. This suggests that in addition to its critical GAP function, the GAP domain is also vital for TSC2 (and hence TSC1) stability. The only amino acid change that resulted in reduced TSC2 and TSC1 signals and mapped outside these two regions was the p.T1203K substitution. This variant maps very close to p.R1200W, another unstable, pathogenic TSC2 variant [Wentink et al., 2012], indicating that this region is also important for TSC1â€“TSC2 stability.In five cases, p.M1?, p.Y1571N, p.T1623I, p.P1675L, and p.L1750Afs25, the TSC2 signal was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type TSC1â€“TSC2 control, whereas the TSC1 signal was not. In these cases, it is most likely that the changes affect TSC2 expression and/or stability, but not sufficiently to result in reductions in the TSC1 signals. The p.M1? variant migrated marginally ahead of wild-type TSC2 and the other variants (Fig. 2C) probably because another, downstream ATG is utilized as the initiating codon. The next ATG is at codon 50, and the sequence surrounding this codon corresponds quite well with the consensus Kozak sequence. Therefore, on the assumption that the p.M1? variant lacks the N-terminal 49 amino acids, our results indicate that this region is more important for TSC2 stability than for the TSC1â€“TSC2 interaction. In the case of the p.L1750Afs25 variant, the reduced signal was because epitopes recognized by our antiserum are disrupted by the frameshift mutation. Expression of the p.L1750Afs25 variant was confirmed with an antibody raised against other TSC2 epitopes (anti-TSC2 mouse monoclonal clone 3G9D9, Zymed Laboratories; data not shown).In nine cases, the TSC1 signal was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type control, even though the TSC2 signal was not significantly affected by the corresponding amino acid change. These variants mapped between amino acids 75 and 844 in the N-terminal region of TSC2 that is essential for the interaction with TSC1 [Nellist et al., 2001] (Supp. Table S1; Fig 1A and B). It is most likely that these changes cause conformational changes that disrupt TSC1 binding as well as TSC1â€“TSC2 RHEB GAP activity, without severely affecting TSC2 stability.Six variants (p.I427M, p.R462C, p.L493V, p.R505Q, p.Y598C, and p.Q1554H) had an intermediate effect on the T389/S6K ratios in our assay. The ratios were significantly increased compared to wild-type TSC2 (mean T389/S6K ratio 1.00) and significantly decreased with respect to the p.R611Q variant (mean T389/S6K ratio 3.72).In addition to an intermediate effect on TORC1 activity, the p.R462C (mean T389/S6K ratio 2.35) and p.Y598C (mean T389/S6K ratio 2.00) variants were associated with clearly reduced TSC1 signals, indicating that these amino acid substitutions interfere with TSC1â€“TSC2 binding, similar to other substitutions at the same codons (p.R462H, p.R462P and p.Y598H [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011]). Therefore, because the T389/S6K ratios were significantly increased relative to wild-type TSC2 and because the TSC1 signals were significantly decreased, we concluded that the p.R462C and p.Y598C changes are probably pathogenic. Both variants were identified in individuals who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for TSC and neither amino acid substitution was tolerated according to the SIFT analysis (Supp. Table S1).The TSC2 p.Q1554H variant also had an intermediate effect on the TSC1â€“TSC2-dependent inhibition of TORC1 (mean T389/S6K ratio 2.09) in our assay, and no significant effects on the TSC1 or TSC2 signals were detected. The TSC2 c.4662G&amp;gt;C (p.Q1554H) nucleotide change was predicted by ALAMUT to disrupt the normal splice acceptor site. Therefore, in addition to the effect of the p.Q1554H substitution on TSC1â€“TSC2 activity it is also possible that the TSC2 c.4662G&amp;gt;C substitution affects splicing of the TSC2 mRNA, resulting in lower levels of the TSC2 p.Q1554H variant protein in vivo. We concluded that the TSC2 c.4662G&amp;gt;C (p.Q1554H) variant was probably a pathogenic mutation, consistent with a previous report on the TSC2 c.4662G&amp;gt;T (p.Q1554H) variant (Rendtorff et al., 2005). Unfortunately, no clinical information was available for the individual carrying the TSC2 c.4662G&amp;gt;C (p.Q1554H) variant.Compared to wild-type TSC2, no significant differences in the TSC1 or TSC2 signals for the p.I427M, p.L493V, and p.R505Q variants were observed, even though all three variants map to the region of TSC2 that is important for TSC1 binding and stabilization. Nonetheless, the T389/S6K ratios were consistently and significantly raised, relative to the wild type. The mean T389/S6K ratios were 1.39, 1.91, and 1.85, respectively, compared to a T389/S6K ratio of 1.00 for wild-type TSC2 and 3.72 for the pathogenic p.R611Q variant (Fig. 1C).The p.I427M variant was identified in an adult with facial angiofibroma, subependymal nodules, and epilepsy. No information on other family members was available. SIFT predicted that the amino acid change would not be tolerated (NT), even though both isoleucine and methionine are hydrophobic amino acids. No potential effects on splicing were identified. We concluded that our assay did not provide conclusive evidence regarding the pathogenicity of this variant. Therefore, we classified the TSC2 c.1281C&amp;gt;G (p.I427M) variant as possibly pathogenic. No clinical information was available for the individual carrying the TSC2 c.1477C&amp;gt;G (p.L493V) variant [Langkau et al., 2002]. Although leucine and valine are very similar amino acids, the p.L493V substitution was classified as not tolerated by SIFT. Therefore, we also classified this variant as possibly pathogenic. The R505Q variant was originally identified in a family that did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for TSC and was shown to have reduced activity relative to wild-type TSC2 [Dunlop et al., 2011]. The variant has also been identified once in a control population of 10 758 individuals not selected according to their TSC status (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/). Our functional data are consistent with those of Dunlop et al., and with the suggestion that the variant may contribute to TSC pathogenicity. Therefore, we classified this variant as possibly pathogenic.The remaining 38 changes (49%) were indistinguishable from wild-type TSC2 in our assays, and we concluded, with one exception (TSC2 c.4136C&amp;gt;T [p.S1379L]; see below), that these are all most likely to be rare, neutral amino acid substitutions. In nine cases, the variant was also identified in a control population (see Supp. Table S1 and http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/).In one case, TSC2 c.4136C&amp;gt;T (p.S1379L), the S6K signals were significantly reduced compared to the control values, suggesting that the transfection efficiencies were lower. Therefore, although the values for the TSC2 and TSC1 signals for the variant were not significantly different from the control values, our functional assessment of this variant might not be completely reliable. Nonetheless, as the T389/S6K ratio was not significantly different from the wild-type control (Fig. 2C), we classified the TSC2 c.4136C&amp;gt;T (p.S1379L) variant as unlikely to be pathogenic. The p.S1379L amino acid substitution was tolerated according to the SIFT analysis, and maps between amino acids 1,203 and 1,496. None of the variants that map to this region and have been tested in our assay affect TSC1â€“TSC2 function (this study and Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011).Forty-five of the amino acid substitutions analyzed as part of this study were predicted by SIFT to be not tolerated (NT). We classified 26 (58%) of these as pathogenic, four (9%) as probably pathogenic and three (7%) as possibly pathogenic. In 12 (27%) cases, we classified changes as probably neutral and therefore discordant with the SIFT prediction. Of the 28 changes that were tolerated (T) according to SIFT, 24 (89%) did not affect TSC2 function in our assay. We classified three (11%) as pathogenic and therefore discordant with the SIFT prediction. Overall, our functional assessment was discordant with the SIFT prediction in 15 cases (21%), in line with previous reports [Hoogeveen-Westerveld et al., 2011].We assessed the effects of 78 TSC2 variants on TSC1â€“TSC2 function and classified the variants into seven different groups according to their stability, their affect on TSC1 stability, their affect on TORC1 activity, and the results of the SIFT analysis. The results of our classification are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 3. Although, in most cases, the clinical and family data on the individuals with the variants were limited (Supp. Table S2), there was only one variant, c.2753C&amp;gt;G (p.S918C), where there was a strong disagreement between our functional assessment and the available clinical and family data.Table 1. Classification of TSC2 VariantsGroup\tSIFT\tTSC2 signal\tTSC1 signal\tT389/S6K ratio\tTSC2 variantsVariants were divided into groups according to the results of the transfection-based immunoblot assay and to whether the changes were predicted to be tolerated (T) or not to be tolerated (NT) by SIFT analysis [Ng and Henikoff, 2006]. Variants showing significantly reduced signals compared to wild-type TSC2 and variants for which the TSC1 signal was significantly reduced are indicated as â€œreduced.â€� For each variant, the ratio of T389-phosphorylated to total S6K was determined (T389/S6K ratio). Variants for which the T389/S6K ratios were significantly higher than wild-type TSC2 are indicated as â€œincreased.â€� This corresponds to increased TORC1 activity, due to reduced TSC1â€“TSC2 function. We identified seven groups of variants. All the variants in groups 1, 3, and 5 were classified as pathogenic; the variants in groups 2 and 4 were classified as either pathogenic, probably pathogenic (indicated with 1.), or possibly pathogenic (indicated with 2.); variants in groups 6 and 7 were classified as probably neutral or unlikely to be pathogenic (indicated with 3.).

Changes to the TSC2 C-terminal region were more likely to disrupt the TSC1â€“TSC2-dependent inhibition of TORC1, without affecting TSC1 levels. However, according to our assessment, amino acid changes mapping within the TSC2 GAP domain can also affect TSC1â€“TSC2 stability. In five cases, TSC2 missense variants had an intermediate effect on TSC1â€“TSC2 activty, consistent with a previous report [Dunlop et al., 2011], and confirming the importance of considering the clinical, genetic, and functional data before a decision is made regarding the pathogenicity of any particular variant.\n",

       "            &lt;td class=&quot;fillremaining&quot; title=&quot;Germline mutations of the breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) gene are a major cause of familial breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCA1 protein displays E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and this enzymatic function is thought to be required for tumor suppression. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice that express an enzymatically defective Brca1. We found that this mutant Brca1 prevents tumor formation to the same degree as does wild-type Brca1 in three different genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of cancer. In contrast, a mutation that ablates phosphoprotein recognition by the BRCA C terminus (BRCT) domains of BRCA1 elicits tumors in each of the three GEM models. Thus, BRCT phosphoprotein recognition, but not the E3 ligase activity, is required for BRCA1 tumor suppression.  Germline mutations of the breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) tumor suppressor are a common cause of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCA1 protein harbors an N-terminal RING motif characteristic of many ubiquitin E3 ligases and two BRCA C terminus (BRCT) motifs that form a phosphoprotein recognition domain (1-4). BRCA1 interacts with BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 (BARD1) to form a potent E3 ligase (5, 6) that is thought to regulate multiple pathways, including those responsible for tumor suppression (1-4). To test whether the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 is essential for tumor suppression, we examined mice that express Brca1FH-I26A, an enzymatically defective protein with a missense mutation (I26A) in the RING domain that allows assembly of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer but abrogates its E3 ligase activity (7, 8). (Single-letter abbreviations for the amino acid residues are as follows: A, Ala; C, Cys; D, Asp; E, Glu; F, Phe; G, Gly; H, His; I, Ile; K, Lys; L, Leu; M, Met; N, Asn; P, Pro; Q, Gln; R, Arg; S, Ser; T, Thr; V, Val; W, Trp; and Y, Tyr. In the mutants, other amino acids were substituted at certain locations; for example, I26A indicates that isoleucine at position 26 was replaced by alanine.) Brca1FH-I26A/+ and Brca1FH-WT/+ mice were generated from isogenic embryonic stem (ES) cells that express either Brca1FH-I26A or the corresponding wild-type Brca1FH-WT protein (9) and bred to homozygosity. Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A pups were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and survived to adulthood. Because Brca1-null mice invariably undergo embryonic lethality (10, 11), the viability of Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A mice indicates that E3 ligase activity is not essential for all BRCA1 functions. Nonetheless, Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A, but not Brca1FH-WT/FH-WT, males are sterile and have smaller testes, and their seminiferous tubules lack elongated spermatids and spermatozoa (fig. S1), which suggests a block in spermatogenesis. Apart from male sterility and a modest decrease in adult body weight (5 to 10%), Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A mice appear indistinguishable from their Brca1FH-WT/FH-WT littermates. Moreover, analyses of Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) revealed that the I26A mutation had no measurable effect on cellular proliferation, chromosomal stability, senescence induction, centrosome number, spindle formation, resistance to genotoxic stress, or ubiquitin foci formation at sites of DNA damageâ€”unlike the hypomorphic Brca1 lesions in MEFs of Brca1tr/tr (12) and Brca1Î”11/Î”11 mice (13), which are known to disrupt tumor suppression (fig. S2).  To evaluate whether the E3 ligase activity affects tumor suppression, we initially used a mouse model of pancreatic cancer in which the Pdx1-cre transgene triggers KrasG12D and p53R172H expression in pancreatic progenitor cells (14). To test whether Brca1 suppresses formation of these tumors, we generated Pdx1-cre animals carrying KrasLSL-G12D (14) together with conditional-null Brca1flex2 (15) and/or p53flex7 (16) alleles. Although double-mutant KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre mice succumbed to pancreatic tumors with an average latency (T50) of 68 days, tumor latency was dramatically reduced in triple-mutant animals (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Brca1flex2/flex2/Pdx1-cre) with conditional-null Brca1flex2 (T50 = 40 days; P &amp;lt; 0.0001), indicating that wild-type Brca1 suppresses pancreatic tumor development (Fig. 1A). In contrast, triple-mutant animals (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Brca1flex2/FH-I26A/Pdx1-cre) expressing Brca1FH-I26A developed pancreatic tumors with a similar latency (T50 = 65 days) as that of double-mutant KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre mice (T50 = 68 days; P = 0.2595) (Fig. 1A). Thus, the tumor suppression potential of enzymatically inactive Brca1 in the pancreas is indistinguishable from that of wild-type Brca1.  Fig. 1 Fig. 1 The enzymatic activity of Brca1 is dispensable for tumor suppression. (A) Kaplan-Meier tumor-free survival curves of KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre (KPC-Brca1+/+; black curve; T50 = 68 days) mice compared with KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre/Brca1 ... We next applied a mouse model of familial breast cancer in which the Wapcre gene elicits mammary-specific inactivation of the conditional-null Brca1flex2 allele (15). However, unlike Brca1flex2/flex2/Wapcre/+ females, which form tumors resembling the basal-like breast carcinomas of human BRCA1 mutation carriers (15), all mice expressing enzymatically inactive Brca1 (Brca1flex2/FH-I26A/Wapcre/+) remained tumor-free over the 24-month observation period (Fig. 1B).  We also monitored three cohorts of Wapcre/+ mice sensitized for tumor development by a conditional p53 mutation (p53LSL-R270H). Whereas mammary tumors developed in control p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females with an average latency of 380 days, which is consistent with previous studies (17), tumor formation was accelerated (T50 = 308 days) by conditional Brca1 inactivation in Brca1flex2/flex2/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) (Fig. 1C). The kinetics of tumor development in Brca1flex2/FH-I26A/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females was indistinguishable from that of control p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females (P = 0.7502) and significantly slower than that of Brca1flex2/flex2/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) (Fig. 1C). Moreover, representative oligonucleotide microarray analysis (18) revealed a â€œsimplexâ€� pattern of genomic copy number variation in Brca1flex2/FH-I26A/p53flex7/flex7/Wapcre/+ tumors, similar to that of p53flex7/flex7/Wapcre/+ tumors but distinct from the â€œcomplex sawtoothâ€� pattern of Brca1flex2/flex2/p53flex7/flex7/Wapcre/+ tumors (fig. S3). Thus, mammary-specific loss of Brca1 enzymatic activity does not promote basal-like breast carcinoma in a manner analogous to complete Brca1 inactivation.  Although mice lacking Brca1 enzymatic activity (Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A and Brca1FH-I26A/âˆ’) are viable, some (18.6%) died of tumors at a very advanced age (Fig. 1D). However, the frequency and kinetics of spontaneous tumor formation in the mutant mice were comparable with those of Brca1FH-WT/FH-WT control animals (P = 0.5197) and significantly lower than those of Brca1tr/tr mice (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) (12). Thus, the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 is dispensable for tumor suppression in each of the three GEM cancer models.  The BRCT motifs of BRCA1 form a phospho-recognition domain that preferentially binds the phosphorylated isoforms of repair proteins Abraxas/CCDC98, BACH1/FancJ, and CtIP (1, 2). Because most tumor-associated BRCA1 alleles have frameshift/nonsense mutations that eliminate one or both BRCT motifs, BRCT phospho-recognition may be critical for tumor suppression. Indeed, in some families breast cancer susceptibility can be ascribed to missense mutations that cause a single amino acid substitution (for example, S1655F) that disrupts the interaction between the BRCT domain and its cognate phospho-ligands. Structural studies show that BRCA1 residue S1655 donates a hydrogen bond to the phosphate group of these phospho-ligands, and that mutation of this residue disrupts their interaction with BRCA1 (19-23). To determine whether BRCT phospho-recognition is required for genome stability and tumor suppression, we mutated the corresponding mouse residue (S1598F) to generate heterozygous (Brca1S1598F/+) and homozygous (Brca1S1598F/S1598F) ES clones (fig. S4). The Brca1S1598F/+ ES cells were injected into blastocysts to derive germline chimeras, and heterozygous animals were then intercrossed to produce homozygous Brca1S1598F/S1598F offspring, which appeared at the expected Mendelian ratio. Apart from male sterility, these mice developed normally and provided a source of Brca1S1598F/S1598F MEFs.  The mutant Brca1 protein of Brca1S1598F/S1598F MEFs is expressed at normal levels and fails to bind Bach1/FancJ (Fig. 2A). Brca1S1598F/S1598F ES cells are hypersensitive to genotoxic stress (Fig. 2B) and defective for homology-directed DNA repair (Fig. 2C). In addition, Brca1S1598F/S1598F MEFs display proliferation defects, chromosomal instability, centrosome amplification, and diminished recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage (figs. S5 and S6). Thus, the S1598F mutation disrupts BRCA1 function in the DNA damage response. To evaluate its effect on tumor suppression, we monitored an experimental cohort of Brca1flex2/S1598F/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females and control cohorts of the p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+, Brca1flex2/flex2/Wapcre/+, and Brca1flex2/flex2/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females described above (Fig. 1, B and C). As shown in Fig. 3A, mammary tumorigenesis was accelerated in experimental Brca1flex2/S1598F/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ mice (T50 = 308 days) relative to p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ animals (T50 = 380 days; P &amp;lt; 0.0001), and the shortened latency was indistinguishable from that of Brca1flex2/flex2/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ animals (T50 = 309 days; P = 0.4543). Thus, the S1598F mutation impairs mammary tumor suppression to a comparable degree as does complete Brca1 inactivation. Pancreatic tumor formation in mice expressing Brca1S1598F (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Brca1flex2/S1598F/Pdx1-cre; T50 = 45 days) was also accelerated relative to those expressing wild-type Brca1 (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre mice; T50 = 68 days; P &amp;lt; 0.0001) (Fig. 3B) and comparable with conditional-null Brca1 mice (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Brca1flex2/flex2/Pdx1-cre) (T50 = 40 days; P = 0.2632). Furthermore, homozygous Brca1S1598F/S1598F mice were highly tumor-prone (49 out of 72; 68.1%) relative to control animals (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) (Fig. 3C). Thus, BRCT phospho-recognition is critical for BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression in all three GEM cancer models.  Fig. 2 Fig. 2 The BRCT phospho-recognition property of Brca1 is critical for the DNA damage response. (A) S1598F ablates the interaction between Bach1/FancJ and endogenous Brca1.

(A) Kaplan-Meier tumor-free survival curves of p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ (PC-Brca1+/+; black curve; T50 = 380 days) females compared with Brca1flex2/flex2/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ (PC-Brca1 ... BRCA1 is thought to regulate diverse cellular processes by ubiquitinating multiple protein substrates (1-4). Indeed, on the basis of the same mutation (I26A) used here the E3 ligase activity has been implicated in BRCA1 control of centrosome duplication (24), checkpoint activation (25), mitotic spindle assembly (26), and tumor cell motility (27). In light of these observations, the viability of mice lacking BRCA1 enzymatic activity was unexpected. Because mice homozygous for null Brca1 mutations undergo embryonic lethality (10, 11), our results suggest that the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 is dispensable for much of normal development. Thus, many of the known and unknown functions of BRCA1 may be mediated independent of its ability to catalyze ubiquitination.  From a medical standpoint, the key function of BRCA1 is its ability to suppress tumor formation in breast and ovarian tissues. Like BRCA1, many other oncoproteins and tumor suppressors possess enzymatic activity. In most cases, the enzymatic function has proven to be integral to the oncogenic process, and in some cases it can be targeted for therapeutic gain, as illustrated by the clinical success of certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, because enzymatically inert Brca1 is sufficient to suppress tumor formation in several settings (Fig. 1), including a model of human basal-like breast cancer, the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 appears to be dispensable for tumor suppression.  A role for the E3 ligase activity in BRCA1 tumor suppression was predicated partly on the fact that this activity is ablated by certain tumor-associated lesions of the RING domain, such as the C61G and C64G missense mutations (6). However, these mutations also disrupt the interaction between BRCA1 and its partner protein BARD1 (5). Because mammary-specific inactivation of either Brca1 or Bard1 elicits breast tumors with the same basal-like phenotype (15), the tumor suppression activity of BRCA1 is probably mediated by the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer. Unlike the tumorigenic C61G and C64G mutations, the synthetic I26A mutation used in this study specifically ablates the enzymatic activity of BRCA1 but allows proper assembly of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer (7). Thus, the tumorigenic RING mutations are likely to compromise BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression primarily by impairing BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimerization.  The mouse model of hereditary breast cancer has provided meaningful insights into the molecular mechanisms of BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression. First, the identical pattern of breast carcinogenesis in conditional Brca1-, Bard1-, and Brca1/Bard1-null mice implies that tumor suppression is dependent on the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer (15). Second, as shown here tumor suppression does not require the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1/BARD1. Third, our data also suggest that the ability of the BRCT domain to bind its phospho-ligands is critical for BRCA1 tumor suppression. In light of this result, it is noteworthy that BRCA1/BARD1 forms distinct protein complexes (A, B, and C) based on BRCT-mediated interactions with three different repair proteins (Abraxas/CCDC98, BACH1/FancJ, and CtIP) (1, 2). Because tumor suppression appears to be dependent on BRCA1 association with one or more of these BRCT phospho-ligands (and/or others yet to be discovered), these interactions may provide valuable targets for therapeutic intervention.  The N-terminus of the Breast Cancer-1 predisposition protein (BRCA1) associates with the BRCA1-associated RING domain-1 protein (BARD1) to form a heterodimer, which exhibits ubiquitin ligase activity that is abrogated by known cancer-associated BRCA1 missense mutations. The majority of missense substitutions identified in patients with a personal or a family history of disease have not been followed in pedigrees, nor there is a functional understanding of their impact. We have examined, by extensive missense substitution, the interaction of BRCA1 with components that contribute to its ubiquitin ligase activity, BARD1 and the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, UbcH5a. Selection from a randomly generated library of BRCA1 missense mutations for variants that inhibit the interaction with these components identified substitutions in residues found altered in patient DNA, indicating a correlation between loss of component-binding and propensity to disease development. We further show that the BRCA1:E2 interaction is sensitive to substitutions in all structural elements of the BRCA1 N-terminus, whereas the BARD1 interaction is sensitive to a subset of BRCA1 substitutions, which also inhibit E2-binding. Patient variants that inhibit the BRCA1:E2 interaction show loss of ubiquitin ligase activity and correlate with disease susceptibility and theoretical predictions of pathogenicity. These data link the loss of ubiquitin ligase activity, through loss of E2-binding, to the majority of non-polymorphic patient variants described within the N-terminus of BRCA1 and illustrate the likely significant role of BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity in tumour suppression. INTRODUCTION Inheritance of mutations in BRCA1 resulting in protein truncation predispose individuals to breast and ovarian cancer, whereas determining the significance of missense variants presents a major clinical problem (1). More than a quarter of entries recorded in the Breast cancer Information Core (BIC) dataset of BRCA1 sequence variants from patients are missense alterations (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/). This study examines the 100 N-terminal amino acids (aa) of BRCA1 that includes the Zn2Ã¾-binding RING domain flanked by two a-helices (2). Forty-four different non-polymorphic missense variants have been reported in patient DNA encoding this region and the most frequently occurring are located within it. The pathogenicity of only a small number of these is known, and the rest remain unclassified. This is because it is not possible to follow the majority of variants by co-segregation analysis and the number of appropriate controls required to be content of a variantâ€™s absence in unaffected individuals is prohibitive. For either approach, incomplete penetrance of the mutation may also be confounding. Thus far theoretical predictions based on evolutionary conservation # The Author 2006.

Human Molecular Genetics, 2006, Vol. 15, No. 4 599â€“606 doi:10.1093/hmg/ddi476 Advance Access published on January 10, 2006 of the region and chemical difference of the substitution have been used to postulate the pathogenicity of many missense variants (3,4) and there is a need for functional understanding to validate such analysis. Currently, without a clinical assay for BRCA1 activity, the discovery of the majority of missense variants leaves both carriers and their families in an ambiguous position. Single exonic nucleotide mutations not associated with transcript stability, splicing or translational efficiency presumably confer loss of BRCA1 tumour suppressor ability through the loss of an activity brought about by protein conformational change. The BRCA1 N-terminal region has been reported to interact with seven protein partners and therefore potentially participates in several cellular activities (5 â€“10). Hence, in common with the study of many disease-associated proteins, a key challenge is to determine which interaction and activities are relevant to the disease process and which are not. An approach frequently taken in classifying a particular protein:protein interaction as significant has been to test the interaction with a disease-associated mutation in one of the protein partners. This approach may result in ambiguity when the disease-associated mutations tested have significant structural consequences (predicting an apparent plethora of significant interactions). The early discovery of BRCA1 and the subsequent reporting of variants from a population likely to be enriched for disease in a public database, the BIC, has provided a resource with which to more thoroughly test potentially important interactions. In the current study, we have made extensive use of, and reference to these variants to examine the likely relevance of the BRCA1 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity to its tumour suppressor function. The BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase is capable of forming covalently linked chains of ubiquitin on a substrate. Endogenous BRCA1-dependent ubiquitin conjugates occur at sites of double-strand DNA breaks and DNA repair in cells suggesting that BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity is linked to the DNA damage repair role of BRCA1 (11). The activity has also been linked to the control of centrosome duplication and microtubule nucleation, transcription and chromosome decatenation (12 â€“ 15). Although classically thought of as a pathway for protein degradation, it is now becoming clear that the posttranslational addition of ubiquitin may act as a signal for other pathways (reviewed in (16)). In vitro, the BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity requires interaction with two proteins. The N-terminus of BRCA1 interacts with BARD1 to form a heterodimer. The heterodimer has substantial E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro with the UbcH5 class of E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, particularly UbcH5a (17,18). Importantly, loss of the activity is likely to occur in some forms of BRCA1-mediated cancer, as disease-associated mutations that substitute Zn2Ã¾-binding residues within the BRCA1 RING affects BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro (19,20). However, as these mutations are structurally deleterious, it is unclear whether loss of ubiquitin ligase activity is causally linked to loss of tumour suppressor activity or an activity lost in conjunction with another, more relevant, interaction. Based on the significant body of structural work that describes the BRCA1 N-terminal region, a proportion of the 44 patient missense variants would be expected to inhibit the BARD1 interaction, and a proportion inhibit the E2 enzyme interaction, while the impact of the remainder cannot be easily predicted. The BRCA1:BARD1 interface is formed of the two helices that flank the BRCA1 RING and mutational analysis has shown that the hydrophobic core formed at the interface is required for this interaction (21,22). The interface BRCA1 makes with the E2 has been predicted to be formed of residues in the two Zn2Ã¾-binding loops and central helix of the RING domain. A missense mutation in a residue within this region prevented the E2 interaction and also ubiquitin ligase activity (20). Thus, patient mutations located close to the predicted E2-binding face are also expected to inhibit E2-binding and ubiquitin ligase activity. Missense alterations that cause a loss of interaction with either BARD1 or the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme would be expected to inhibit significant BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro (17,20). This study employs a comprehensive examination of missense variants derived from patient DNA to explore the relevance of BRCA1:protein interactions required for the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of BRCA1. Our data show that loss of binding with the E2 component of the cascade correlates with variants found in a population enriched for a personal and family history of breast and ovarian cancer, ubiquitin ligase activity and theoretical predictions of pathogenicity. The data reveals the particular sensitivity of the BRCA1:E2 interaction to missense substitution within and beyond the predicted E2 interaction face and has implications for the clinical interpretation of missense variants within the N-terminus of BRCA1. RESULTS Selection of mutants from a randomly mutagenized BRCA1 library for loss of E2- or BARD1-binding identifies disease-associated mutations If BRCA1-mediated tumourigenesis is promoted through the loss of binding to components of the ubiquitin ligase cascade we predicted that a screen for substitutions that inhibit E2 or BARD1 protein interactions from a randomly generated series of BRCA1 variants should identify substitutions similar to non-polymorphic variants reported in DNA from individuals with a personal or family history of breast cancer. We therefore screened a BRCA1 library generated through random mutagenic PCR by positive selection in yeast for loss of the BRCA1:BARD1 interaction and the BRCA1:E2 interaction (as illustrated in Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). These screens identified residues within BRCA1 that are required for interaction with each protein. In a screen of the BRCA1 mutant library for substitutions that inhibit interaction with the E2 enzyme, UbcH5a, we identified 22 missense variants in 19 residues (Fig. 1, line 1). In the first screen against BARD1, we identified only truncating and frame-shift alterations (the truncation that deleted fewest residues removed amino acids from the C-terminal region of the peptide leaving aa 2â€“ 90), indicating that few or no single amino acid substitutions prevent BRCA1:BARD1 heterodimer formation in this system. We therefore conducted a third screen in which we selected mutations that inhibit the 600 Human Molecular Genetics, 2006, Vol. 15, No. 4 interaction with BARD1 using a strain optimized for highaffinity interactions (23). From this experiment eight missense variants in seven residues were identified (Fig. 1, line 2). We sought sequence information of patient variants from the literature (24,25) and from the BIC dataset. This carries BRCA1 sequence information from over 10 000 individuals, most with a personal or a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, hence it is a database that is enriched with deleterious mutations in BRCA1 (although the pathogenicity of the majority of individual variants is not known) (3). Comparison of the BRCA1 variants selected from the screens against the E2 and BARD1 with non-polymorphic variants encoded by patient DNA show that both interactions are inhibited by substitutions in residues that because of their co-ordination with structurally integral Zn2Ã¾ have been strongly predicted, or confirmed, to be involved in disease (Fig. 1, lines 1 â€“3). A further four selected variants from the E2 screen result in the substitution of residues altered in patient DNA in non-Zn2Ã¾-binding residues (Fig. 1), including the substitution of M18. The M18T/K missense variant has been identified in several independent families with breast and ovarian cancer (24,25). No variant identified in either screen is a known polymorphism. Hence, selection against either ubiquitin ligase cascade component, although interacting with BRCA1 at different affinities, identified substitutions of residues found altered in patient DNA, but only the E2 screen selected patient variants outside the structurally integral Zn2Ã¾-binding residues. The E2 component is more sensitive to BRCA1 patient missense variants As experimental selection against the BARD1 and the E2 interactions identified variants that correlated with patient variants, we next wished to test directly the relative sensitivities of each protein interaction to non-polymorphic missense substitutions in BRCA1 encoded by patient DNA. We therefore generated constructs of all variants encoded within the first 100 amino acids of BRCA1 logged in the BIC database; both those known to be disease-associated and those that are unclassified. (Where multiple substitutions of Zn2Ã¾-ligating cysteines have been reported, one variant was chosen; in addition M18K was generated (25).) These 35 variants were then tested for interaction with BARD1 and the E2 enzyme, UbcH5a, in a two-hybrid assay. Figure 2 shows that the wild-type BRCA1:BARD1 interaction was stronger than that of the BRCA1:E2 interaction as indicated by growth at high levels of the HIS3 competitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3AT) (Fig. 2A). A subset of BRCA1 missense substitutions inhibited growth with BARD1 at high 3AT concentrations (100 mM). These were mutations of Zn2Ã¾-binding residues, either previously confirmed or strongly expected to be pathogenic (C24R, C44F, C61G and to a lesser extent H41R and C39R). The E2:BRCA1 interaction was more sensitive to missense substitution, 16 variants showed no interaction with the E2 at the lowest concentration of 3AT (1 mM), with 21 BRCA1 variants failed to grow at 3 mM 3AT (Fig. 2A). All Zn2Ã¾- binding residue mutations inhibited the E2 interaction at 3 mM 3AT threshold and all patient variants that reduced the BARD1 interaction at a high threshold (100 mM 3AT), inhibited the E2 interaction at a lower one (1 mM 3AT). This was also the case for a non-patient mutation (L82D) selected for disruption of the BRCA1:BARD1 interaction (data not shown). Hence, we were unable to identify a missense mutation of BRCA1 that inhibited the BARD1 interaction, but that did not disrupt the interaction with the E2 enzyme. In a recent study, a combination of sequence alignment of BRCA1 orthologs and chemical difference of substitution was used to classify patient variants pathogenically (3). In the current study, seven of nine patient variants predicted to be deleterious using this approach inhibited the E2 interaction and all (five) variants predicted to be neutral, or of little significance, interacted with the E2 enzyme (Fig. 2C). (Experiments designed to test BRCA1 N-terminal homodimerization failed to reveal an interaction and we saw no interaction between BARD1 and UbcH5a (data not shown).) Loss of E2 interaction correlates with loss of BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity The sensitivity of the E2:BRCA1 interaction to missense substitution of BRCA1 suggested that the majority of nonpolymorphic missense variants reported in the population enriched for family or personal history of cancer might inhibit BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity, as confirmed breast cancer-associated missense variants do. In order to test this, we performed a biochemical assay which examined the ability of the BRCA1:BARD1 heterodimer to form ubiquitin Figure 1. Single amino acid substitutions in BRCA1 identified by split-hybrid selection against the E2 (UbcH5a) (line 1) and BARD1 (line 2): Variants from individuals recorded in the BIC database and reference (25) (line 3). Substitutions classified as known mutations are shown in bold (BIC database and references (24,25)). Green-shaded boxes illustrate residues substituted in variants identified from the E2 (UbcH5a) and BARD1 screens that are located in residues also substituted in patient DNA. Human Molecular Genetics, 2006, Vol. 15, No. 4 601 chains in the presence of the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, UbcH5a. In this assay, co-purified wild-type BRCA1: BARD1 N-terminal complex was able to generate polyubiquitin chains and underwent extensive auto-ubiquitination (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Material, Fig. S2). Nineteen of the 35 BRCA1 variants co-purified with BARD1 showed reduced activity in the assay. As expected all seven mutations in Zn2Ã¾-ligating residues inhibited ubiquitin ligase activity and the activity of the remaining variants correlated with the BRCA1:E2 interaction (compare Fig. 2A with B, summarized in C). All variants that interacted with E2 at 10 mM 3AT had ubiquitin ligase activity and all but one that did not interact at this threshold showed no activity. The E2-binding activity of a single variant, with a helical substitution (I89T) correlates poorly with its ubiquitin ligase activity. It is possible that the E2 interaction is stabilized by the presence of BARD1 in the biochemical assay. The BRCA1:E2 interaction requires integrity of the BRCA1 N-terminus The BARD1 interaction was less sensitive to missense substitution of BRCA1 than the E2 interaction and restricted to the flanking helices that form the BRCA1:BARD1 interaction face (Q12Y, L82P) and the Zn2Ã¾-ligating residues of the RING (C39S/L, H41R, C44R, C47R and C61L) (Fig. 3H). However, the impact of these variants was measurable only at high concentrations of 3AT, or in a high threshold assay, suggesting that these mutations weaken the high-affinity BARD1:BRCA1 interaction. Conversely, the BRCA1 Figure 2. (A) BARD1 (amino acids 26â€“119) or full length E2 (UbcH5a), were tested for interaction with wild-type or variant BRCA1 (amino acids 2 â€“101), using yeast two-hybrid.

Growth on increasing concentrations of the HIS3 competitive inhibitor 3AT indicates strong protein:protein interaction. Triangles represent serial dilutions of yeast. (B) His-tagged BRCA1 (amino acids 1â€“147) and BARD1 (amino acids 26â€“142) were co-purified from bacteria, and checked for parity before being subjected to substrateindependent ubiquitin ligase assay with the E2 (UbcH5a) enzyme. The I26A BRCA1 variant fails to bind the E2 enzyme and is ubiquitin ligase dead (20), and was included here as a negative control. Ub-mix indicates the inclusion of all components of the assay except BRCA1:BARD1 heterodimer. Several blots are spliced together to allow ease of comparison with (A). (Full blots with relevant controls are shown in Supplementary Material, Fig. S3.) The BRCA1: protein interaction and ubiquitin ligase data are summarized in (C) together with known (K) or predicted pathogenic status (3). Substitutions predicted to be deleterious (D), likely to be neutral or of little significance (N) or because of splice junction defect (S) (32) are shown. 602 Human Molecular Genetics, 2006, Vol. 15, No. 4 interaction with E2 was disrupted by many missense substitutions and at low 3AT concentrations. Modelling the BRCA1:E2 interaction on the solved RING E3:E2 complex of câ€“Cbl (shown in Fig. 3) and comparing it with the NMR solution structure of BRCA1:BARD1 reveals that the face between the RING-E3 and E2 (UbcH7) is not as extensive as the BRCA1:BARD1 interaction. The BARD1:BRCA1 interface is bigger (1337 versus 869 AËš 2 ), flatter and has a smaller gap volume, indicating that it is a tighter interaction. Both interactions have three hydrogen bonds but the BRCA1: BARD1 interaction also has two more salt bridges. Hence, single amino acid substitutions may be tolerated by the BRCA1:BARD1 interaction. Some of the amino acid substitutions of BRCA1 that inhibit the E2 interaction are located in the predicted E2 interface; in residues that co-ordinate with Zn2Ã¾ and that are within the central helix (Fig. 3C, E and H). However, the BRCA1:E2 interaction was also sensitive to non-E2 interface substitutions present within loops forming the cross-brace structure of the RING (Fig. 3D), at the join between the RING domain and flanking helices (Fig. 3F), as well as within the flanking helices (Fig. 3G). Substitutions that did not inhibit the E2 interaction are conservative in their nature (V11A, I15L, I21V, I42V, L87V), away from the E2 interface (D67E/Y, R71G, K38N) or in the distal portions of the a-helices (S4P, R7C, I90T, D96N, G98R and also Y105C, I124V and P142H (data not shown)) (illustrated in Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). Thus the locations and type of the majority of E2 disruptive variants Figure 3. Model of the BARD1:BRCA1:E2 (UbcH5b) complex. The RING domain of BRCA1 (PDB 1JM7 chain A (2)) was superimposed on the RING domain of Cbl-UbcH7 (PDB 1FBV (29)) and the structure of UbcH5b (PDB 1W4U (31)) was then superimposed on the structure of UbcH7 in the Cblâ€“UbcH7 complex.

Line 2 shows residues in the BRCA1:BARD1 interface (blue) (2) and residues identi- fied by Brzovic et al., (20) whose resonances are perturbed by the binding of the E2 (UbcH5c) and are therefore likely to make up the E2 interface (black). Line 3 summarizes all the E2 disruptive substitutions identified in the study, and Line 4 the BARD1 disruptive substitutions. Human Molecular Genetics, 2006, Vol. 15, No. 4 603 illustrate that the integrity of the BRCA1 RING domain, the flanking helices and the relationship between these elements are required for interaction with the E2 (Table 1). DISCUSSION The identification of several interacting proteins have suggested alternative functions for the BRCA1 N-terminal region (6 â€“10). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that this region participates in a function unrelated to ubiquitin ligase activity, in our hands BRCA1 N-terminal interactions with full length ATF, BAP1 and reported interacting regions of ER-alpha, MSH2 and p300/CBP could not be confirmed (data not shown). Data reported here correlate missense variants from individuals with a personal or family history of breast cancer with loss of E2 enzyme interaction and ubiquitin ligase activity. Selection from a randomly generated library of BRCA1 mutations for variants that inhibit the interaction with BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase components, BARD1 or the E2 enzyme, UbcH5a, identified substitutions in residues found altered in patient DNA. The majority of patient variants inhibited the E2 interaction, and mutations in Zn2Ã¾-binding residues reduced the already low-affinity BRCA1:E2 interaction (and weakened the high-affinity BRCA1:BARD1 interaction). Causal confirmation linking the loss of the BRCA1:E2 interaction with tumour susceptibility awaits further experiments where the subtle disruption of the E2 interaction, perhaps in an animal model, is shown to be tumourigenic. However, concordance of loss of BRCA1:E2-binding with variants confirmed or theoretically predicted to be pathogenic suggests that the BRCA1:E2 interaction may be an indicator of variant pathogenicity and may therefore form the basis of a functional assay. Further validation through investigation of BRCA1 families bearing currently unclassified variants, and continued reporting in public databases such as the BIC will be needed to confirm this for the purposes of diagnosis, counselling and clinical intervention. Our data are unable to dissect BARD1 from the E2 interaction as a cause of loss of ubiquitin ligase activity for the Zn2Ã¾-ligating residue class of mutations as these variants cause loss of binding to BARD1 and the E2 enzyme. This is presumably because of the deleterious impact these variants have on the N-terminal structure as a whole, preventing both correct folding of the RING domain and proper folding of the half helical bundle for high-affinity interaction with BARD1. Importantly, the inhibition of ubiquitin ligase activity, through loss of the E2 interaction, was not restricted to structurally detrimental mutations in Zn2Ã¾-ligating residues, Table 1.

The profile of BARD1 and E2 disruptive variants overlap; while E2 disruptive substitutions include Zn2Ã¾ residue binding mutants, they are also located throughout the N-terminal region, as are patient variants (Figs 1 and 3H). Our findings have revealed the fragility of the BRCA1:E2 interaction, which is sensitive to missense substitution in all elements of the BRCA1-N-terminus. The high density of missense variants in the BIC patient database in this region of BRCA1 may reflect a requirement for interaction with the E2 enzyme in tumour suppression. In cells, the formation of ubiquitin conjugates by exogenous BRCA1 is dependent both on BARD1 and on an intact BRCA1:E2-binding face, suggesting that loss of the E2 interaction alone is sufficient to inhibit BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity in cells (11). However, as substitution of Zn2Ã¾-binding residues are many times more frequent in patients than those elsewhere in the N-terminal region, it may be that the additional loss of interaction with BARD1, perhaps resulting in reduced BRCA1 protein stability (19,26), or loss of a further function, causes greater inhibition of BRCA1 tumour suppressor function, and more frequently results in tumourigenesis than loss of the E2 interaction alone. We speculate that a weak interaction between the E3 RING and its E2 component may be a necessary part of enzyme turnover in the generation of ubiquitin chains. The E3 RING:E2 interaction is a common biological interface, with more than 300 RING-bearing proteins in the human database, many of which may function as E3 ligases for ubiquitin or ubiquitin like molecules (27). Hence, if the conclusions made in relation to the BRCA1 RING:E2 interaction can be extrapolated to other RING:E2s, then we would expect perturbations in this interactive face to occur in other diseases and syndromes.&quot;&gt;\n",
       "                Germline mutations of the breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) gene are a major cause of familial breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCA1 protein displays E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and this enzymatic function is thought to be required for tumor suppression. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice that express an enzymatically defective Brca1. We found that this mutant Brca1 prevents tumor formation to the same degree as does wild-type Brca1 in three different genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of cancer. In contrast, a mutation that ablates phosphoprotein recognition by the BRCA C terminus (BRCT) domains of BRCA1 elicits tumors in each of the three GEM models. Thus, BRCT phosphoprotein recognition, but not the E3 ligase activity, is required for BRCA1 tumor suppression.  Germline mutations of the breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) tumor suppressor are a common cause of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCA1 protein harbors an N-terminal RING motif characteristic of many ubiquitin E3 ligases and two BRCA C terminus (BRCT) motifs that form a phosphoprotein recognition domain (1-4). BRCA1 interacts with BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 (BARD1) to form a potent E3 ligase (5, 6) that is thought to regulate multiple pathways, including those responsible for tumor suppression (1-4). To test whether the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 is essential for tumor suppression, we examined mice that express Brca1FH-I26A, an enzymatically defective protein with a missense mutation (I26A) in the RING domain that allows assembly of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer but abrogates its E3 ligase activity (7, 8). (Single-letter abbreviations for the amino acid residues are as follows: A, Ala; C, Cys; D, Asp; E, Glu; F, Phe; G, Gly; H, His; I, Ile; K, Lys; L, Leu; M, Met; N, Asn; P, Pro; Q, Gln; R, Arg; S, Ser; T, Thr; V, Val; W, Trp; and Y, Tyr. In the mutants, other amino acids were substituted at certain locations; for example, I26A indicates that isoleucine at position 26 was replaced by alanine.) Brca1FH-I26A/+ and Brca1FH-WT/+ mice were generated from isogenic embryonic stem (ES) cells that express either Brca1FH-I26A or the corresponding wild-type Brca1FH-WT protein (9) and bred to homozygosity. Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A pups were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and survived to adulthood. Because Brca1-null mice invariably undergo embryonic lethality (10, 11), the viability of Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A mice indicates that E3 ligase activity is not essential for all BRCA1 functions. Nonetheless, Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A, but not Brca1FH-WT/FH-WT, males are sterile and have smaller testes, and their seminiferous tubules lack elongated spermatids and spermatozoa (fig. S1), which suggests a block in spermatogenesis. Apart from male sterility and a modest decrease in adult body weight (5 to 10%), Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A mice appear indistinguishable from their Brca1FH-WT/FH-WT littermates. Moreover, analyses of Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) revealed that the I26A mutation had no measurable effect on cellular proliferation, chromosomal stability, senescence induction, centrosome number, spindle formation, resistance to genotoxic stress, or ubiquitin foci formation at sites of DNA damageâ€”unlike the hypomorphic Brca1 lesions in MEFs of Brca1tr/tr (12) and Brca1Î”11/Î”11 mice (13), which are known to disrupt tumor suppression (fig. S2).  To evaluate whether the E3 ligase activity affects tumor suppression, we initially used a mouse model of pancreatic cancer in which the Pdx1-cre transgene triggers KrasG12D and p53R172H expression in pancreatic progenitor cells (14). To test whether Brca1 suppresses formation of these tumors, we generated Pdx1-cre animals carrying KrasLSL-G12D (14) together with conditional-null Brca1flex2 (15) and/or p53flex7 (16) alleles. Although double-mutant KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre mice succumbed to pancreatic tumors with an average latency (T50) of 68 days, tumor latency was dramatically reduced in triple-mutant animals (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Brca1flex2/flex2/Pdx1-cre) with conditional-null Brca1flex2 (T50 = 40 days; P &amp;lt; 0.0001), indicating that wild-type Brca1 suppresses pancreatic tumor development (Fig. 1A). In contrast, triple-mutant animals (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Brca1flex2/FH-I26A/Pdx1-cre) expressing Brca1FH-I26A developed pancreatic tumors with a similar latency (T50 = 65 days) as that of double-mutant KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre mice (T50 = 68 days; P = 0.2595) (Fig. 1A). Thus, the tumor suppression potential of enzymatically inactive Brca1 in the pancreas is indistinguishable from that of wild-type Brca1.  Fig. 1 Fig. 1 The enzymatic activity of Brca1 is dispensable for tumor suppression. (A) Kaplan-Meier tumor-free survival curves of KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre (KPC-Brca1+/+; black curve; T50 = 68 days) mice compared with KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre/Brca1 ... We next applied a mouse model of familial breast cancer in which the Wapcre gene elicits mammary-specific inactivation of the conditional-null Brca1flex2 allele (15). However, unlike Brca1flex2/flex2/Wapcre/+ females, which form tumors resembling the basal-like breast carcinomas of human BRCA1 mutation carriers (15), all mice expressing enzymatically inactive Brca1 (Brca1flex2/FH-I26A/Wapcre/+) remained tumor-free over the 24-month observation period (Fig. 1B).  We also monitored three cohorts of Wapcre/+ mice sensitized for tumor development by a conditional p53 mutation (p53LSL-R270H). Whereas mammary tumors developed in control p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females with an average latency of 380 days, which is consistent with previous studies (17), tumor formation was accelerated (T50 = 308 days) by conditional Brca1 inactivation in Brca1flex2/flex2/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) (Fig. 1C). The kinetics of tumor development in Brca1flex2/FH-I26A/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females was indistinguishable from that of control p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females (P = 0.7502) and significantly slower than that of Brca1flex2/flex2/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) (Fig. 1C). Moreover, representative oligonucleotide microarray analysis (18) revealed a â€œsimplexâ€� pattern of genomic copy number variation in Brca1flex2/FH-I26A/p53flex7/flex7/Wapcre/+ tumors, similar to that of p53flex7/flex7/Wapcre/+ tumors but distinct from the â€œcomplex sawtoothâ€� pattern of Brca1flex2/flex2/p53flex7/flex7/Wapcre/+ tumors (fig. S3). Thus, mammary-specific loss of Brca1 enzymatic activity does not promote basal-like breast carcinoma in a manner analogous to complete Brca1 inactivation.  Although mice lacking Brca1 enzymatic activity (Brca1FH-I26A/FH-I26A and Brca1FH-I26A/âˆ’) are viable, some (18.6%) died of tumors at a very advanced age (Fig. 1D). However, the frequency and kinetics of spontaneous tumor formation in the mutant mice were comparable with those of Brca1FH-WT/FH-WT control animals (P = 0.5197) and significantly lower than those of Brca1tr/tr mice (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) (12). Thus, the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 is dispensable for tumor suppression in each of the three GEM cancer models.  The BRCT motifs of BRCA1 form a phospho-recognition domain that preferentially binds the phosphorylated isoforms of repair proteins Abraxas/CCDC98, BACH1/FancJ, and CtIP (1, 2). Because most tumor-associated BRCA1 alleles have frameshift/nonsense mutations that eliminate one or both BRCT motifs, BRCT phospho-recognition may be critical for tumor suppression. Indeed, in some families breast cancer susceptibility can be ascribed to missense mutations that cause a single amino acid substitution (for example, S1655F) that disrupts the interaction between the BRCT domain and its cognate phospho-ligands. Structural studies show that BRCA1 residue S1655 donates a hydrogen bond to the phosphate group of these phospho-ligands, and that mutation of this residue disrupts their interaction with BRCA1 (19-23). To determine whether BRCT phospho-recognition is required for genome stability and tumor suppression, we mutated the corresponding mouse residue (S1598F) to generate heterozygous (Brca1S1598F/+) and homozygous (Brca1S1598F/S1598F) ES clones (fig. S4). The Brca1S1598F/+ ES cells were injected into blastocysts to derive germline chimeras, and heterozygous animals were then intercrossed to produce homozygous Brca1S1598F/S1598F offspring, which appeared at the expected Mendelian ratio. Apart from male sterility, these mice developed normally and provided a source of Brca1S1598F/S1598F MEFs.  The mutant Brca1 protein of Brca1S1598F/S1598F MEFs is expressed at normal levels and fails to bind Bach1/FancJ (Fig. 2A). Brca1S1598F/S1598F ES cells are hypersensitive to genotoxic stress (Fig. 2B) and defective for homology-directed DNA repair (Fig. 2C). In addition, Brca1S1598F/S1598F MEFs display proliferation defects, chromosomal instability, centrosome amplification, and diminished recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage (figs. S5 and S6). Thus, the S1598F mutation disrupts BRCA1 function in the DNA damage response. To evaluate its effect on tumor suppression, we monitored an experimental cohort of Brca1flex2/S1598F/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females and control cohorts of the p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+, Brca1flex2/flex2/Wapcre/+, and Brca1flex2/flex2/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ females described above (Fig. 1, B and C). As shown in Fig. 3A, mammary tumorigenesis was accelerated in experimental Brca1flex2/S1598F/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ mice (T50 = 308 days) relative to p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ animals (T50 = 380 days; P &amp;lt; 0.0001), and the shortened latency was indistinguishable from that of Brca1flex2/flex2/p53LSL-R270H/+/Wapcre/+ animals (T50 = 309 days; P = 0.4543). Thus, the S1598F mutation impairs mammary tumor suppression to a comparable degree as does complete Brca1 inactivation. Pancreatic tumor formation in mice expressing Brca1S1598F (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Brca1flex2/S1598F/Pdx1-cre; T50 = 45 days) was also accelerated relative to those expressing wild-type Brca1 (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Pdx1-cre mice; T50 = 68 days; P &amp;lt; 0.0001) (Fig. 3B) and comparable with conditional-null Brca1 mice (KrasLSL-G12D/p53flex7/flex7/Brca1flex2/flex2/Pdx1-cre) (T50 = 40 days; P = 0.2632). Furthermore, homozygous Brca1S1598F/S1598F mice were highly tumor-prone (49 out of 72; 68.1%) relative to control animals (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) (Fig. 3C). Thus, BRCT phospho-recognition is critical for BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression in all three GEM cancer models.

BRCA1 is thought to regulate diverse cellular processes by ubiquitinating multiple protein substrates (1-4). Indeed, on the basis of the same mutation (I26A) used here the E3 ligase activity has been implicated in BRCA1 control of centrosome duplication (24), checkpoint activation (25), mitotic spindle assembly (26), and tumor cell motility (27). In light of these observations, the viability of mice lacking BRCA1 enzymatic activity was unexpected. Because mice homozygous for null Brca1 mutations undergo embryonic lethality (10, 11), our results suggest that the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 is dispensable for much of normal development. Thus, many of the known and unknown functions of BRCA1 may be mediated independent of its ability to catalyze ubiquitination.  From a medical standpoint, the key function of BRCA1 is its ability to suppress tumor formation in breast and ovarian tissues. Like BRCA1, many other oncoproteins and tumor suppressors possess enzymatic activity. In most cases, the enzymatic function has proven to be integral to the oncogenic process, and in some cases it can be targeted for therapeutic gain, as illustrated by the clinical success of certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, because enzymatically inert Brca1 is sufficient to suppress tumor formation in several settings (Fig. 1), including a model of human basal-like breast cancer, the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 appears to be dispensable for tumor suppression.  A role for the E3 ligase activity in BRCA1 tumor suppression was predicated partly on the fact that this activity is ablated by certain tumor-associated lesions of the RING domain, such as the C61G and C64G missense mutations (6). However, these mutations also disrupt the interaction between BRCA1 and its partner protein BARD1 (5). Because mammary-specific inactivation of either Brca1 or Bard1 elicits breast tumors with the same basal-like phenotype (15), the tumor suppression activity of BRCA1 is probably mediated by the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer. Unlike the tumorigenic C61G and C64G mutations, the synthetic I26A mutation used in this study specifically ablates the enzymatic activity of BRCA1 but allows proper assembly of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer (7). Thus, the tumorigenic RING mutations are likely to compromise BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression primarily by impairing BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimerization.  The mouse model of hereditary breast cancer has provided meaningful insights into the molecular mechanisms of BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression. First, the identical pattern of breast carcinogenesis in conditional Brca1-, Bard1-, and Brca1/Bard1-null mice implies that tumor suppression is dependent on the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer (15). Second, as shown here tumor suppression does not require the E3 ligase activity of BRCA1/BARD1. Third, our data also suggest that the ability of the BRCT domain to bind its phospho-ligands is critical for BRCA1 tumor suppression. In light of this result, it is noteworthy that BRCA1/BARD1 forms distinct protein complexes (A, B, and C) based on BRCT-mediated interactions with three different repair proteins (Abraxas/CCDC98, BACH1/FancJ, and CtIP) (1, 2). Because tumor suppression appears to be dependent on BRCA1 association with one or more of these BRCT phospho-ligands (and/or others yet to be discovered), these interactions may provide valuable targets for therapeutic intervention.  The N-terminus of the Breast Cancer-1 predisposition protein (BRCA1) associates with the BRCA1-associated RING domain-1 protein (BARD1) to form a heterodimer, which exhibits ubiquitin ligase activity that is abrogated by known cancer-associated BRCA1 missense mutations. The majority of missense substitutions identified in patients with a personal or a family history of disease have not been followed in pedigrees, nor there is a functional understanding of their impact. We have examined, by extensive missense substitution, the interaction of BRCA1 with components that contribute to its ubiquitin ligase activity, BARD1 and the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, UbcH5a. Selection from a randomly generated library of BRCA1 missense mutations for variants that inhibit the interaction with these components identified substitutions in residues found altered in patient DNA, indicating a correlation between loss of component-binding and propensity to disease development. We further show that the BRCA1:E2 interaction is sensitive to substitutions in all structural elements of the BRCA1 N-terminus, whereas the BARD1 interaction is sensitive to a subset of BRCA1 substitutions, which also inhibit E2-binding. Patient variants that inhibit the BRCA1:E2 interaction show loss of ubiquitin ligase activity and correlate with disease susceptibility and theoretical predictions of pathogenicity. These data link the loss of ubiquitin ligase activity, through loss of E2-binding, to the majority of non-polymorphic patient variants described within the N-terminus of BRCA1 and illustrate the likely significant role of BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity in tumour suppression. INTRODUCTION Inheritance of mutations in BRCA1 resulting in protein truncation predispose individuals to breast and ovarian cancer, whereas determining the significance of missense variants presents a major clinical problem (1). More than a quarter of entries recorded in the Breast cancer Information Core (BIC) dataset of BRCA1 sequence variants from patients are missense alterations (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/). This study examines the 100 N-terminal amino acids (aa) of BRCA1 that includes the Zn2Ã¾-binding RING domain flanked by two a-helices (2). Forty-four different non-polymorphic missense variants have been reported in patient DNA encoding this region and the most frequently occurring are located within it. The pathogenicity of only a small number of these is known, and the rest remain unclassified. This is because it is not possible to follow the majority of variants by co-segregation analysis and the number of appropriate controls required to be content of a variantâ€™s absence in unaffected individuals is prohibitive. For either approach, incomplete penetrance of the mutation may also be confounding. Thus far theoretical predictions based on evolutionary conservation # The Author 2006.

Human Molecular Genetics, 2006, Vol. 15, No. 4 599â€“606 doi:10.1093/hmg/ddi476 Advance Access published on January 10, 2006 of the region and chemical difference of the substitution have been used to postulate the pathogenicity of many missense variants (3,4) and there is a need for functional understanding to validate such analysis. Currently, without a clinical assay for BRCA1 activity, the discovery of the majority of missense variants leaves both carriers and their families in an ambiguous position. Single exonic nucleotide mutations not associated with transcript stability, splicing or translational efficiency presumably confer loss of BRCA1 tumour suppressor ability through the loss of an activity brought about by protein conformational change. The BRCA1 N-terminal region has been reported to interact with seven protein partners and therefore potentially participates in several cellular activities (5 â€“10). Hence, in common with the study of many disease-associated proteins, a key challenge is to determine which interaction and activities are relevant to the disease process and which are not. An approach frequently taken in classifying a particular protein:protein interaction as significant has been to test the interaction with a disease-associated mutation in one of the protein partners. This approach may result in ambiguity when the disease-associated mutations tested have significant structural consequences (predicting an apparent plethora of significant interactions). The early discovery of BRCA1 and the subsequent reporting of variants from a population likely to be enriched for disease in a public database, the BIC, has provided a resource with which to more thoroughly test potentially important interactions. In the current study, we have made extensive use of, and reference to these variants to examine the likely relevance of the BRCA1 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity to its tumour suppressor function. The BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase is capable of forming covalently linked chains of ubiquitin on a substrate. Endogenous BRCA1-dependent ubiquitin conjugates occur at sites of double-strand DNA breaks and DNA repair in cells suggesting that BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity is linked to the DNA damage repair role of BRCA1 (11). The activity has also been linked to the control of centrosome duplication and microtubule nucleation, transcription and chromosome decatenation (12 â€“ 15). Although classically thought of as a pathway for protein degradation, it is now becoming clear that the posttranslational addition of ubiquitin may act as a signal for other pathways (reviewed in (16)). In vitro, the BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity requires interaction with two proteins. The N-terminus of BRCA1 interacts with BARD1 to form a heterodimer. The heterodimer has substantial E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro with the UbcH5 class of E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, particularly UbcH5a (17,18). Importantly, loss of the activity is likely to occur in some forms of BRCA1-mediated cancer, as disease-associated mutations that substitute Zn2Ã¾-binding residues within the BRCA1 RING affects BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro (19,20). However, as these mutations are structurally deleterious, it is unclear whether loss of ubiquitin ligase activity is causally linked to loss of tumour suppressor activity or an activity lost in conjunction with another, more relevant, interaction. Based on the significant body of structural work that describes the BRCA1 N-terminal region, a proportion of the 44 patient missense variants would be expected to inhibit the BARD1 interaction, and a proportion inhibit the E2 enzyme interaction, while the impact of the remainder cannot be easily predicted. The BRCA1:BARD1 interface is formed of the two helices that flank the BRCA1 RING and mutational analysis has shown that the hydrophobic core formed at the interface is required for this interaction (21,22). The interface BRCA1 makes with the E2 has been predicted to be formed of residues in the two Zn2Ã¾-binding loops and central helix of the RING domain. A missense mutation in a residue within this region prevented the E2 interaction and also ubiquitin ligase activity (20). Thus, patient mutations located close to the predicted E2-binding face are also expected to inhibit E2-binding and ubiquitin ligase activity. Missense alterations that cause a loss of interaction with either BARD1 or the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme would be expected to inhibit significant BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro (17,20). This study employs a comprehensive examination of missense variants derived from patient DNA to explore the relevance of BRCA1:protein interactions required for the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of BRCA1. Our data show that loss of binding with the E2 component of the cascade correlates with variants found in a population enriched for a personal and family history of breast and ovarian cancer, ubiquitin ligase activity and theoretical predictions of pathogenicity. The data reveals the particular sensitivity of the BRCA1:E2 interaction to missense substitution within and beyond the predicted E2 interaction face and has implications for the clinical interpretation of missense variants within the N-terminus of BRCA1. RESULTS Selection of mutants from a randomly mutagenized BRCA1 library for loss of E2- or BARD1-binding identifies disease-associated mutations If BRCA1-mediated tumourigenesis is promoted through the loss of binding to components of the ubiquitin ligase cascade we predicted that a screen for substitutions that inhibit E2 or BARD1 protein interactions from a randomly generated series of BRCA1 variants should identify substitutions similar to non-polymorphic variants reported in DNA from individuals with a personal or family history of breast cancer. We therefore screened a BRCA1 library generated through random mutagenic PCR by positive selection in yeast for loss of the BRCA1:BARD1 interaction and the BRCA1:E2 interaction (as illustrated in Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). These screens identified residues within BRCA1 that are required for interaction with each protein. In a screen of the BRCA1 mutant library for substitutions that inhibit interaction with the E2 enzyme, UbcH5a, we identified 22 missense variants in 19 residues (Fig. 1, line 1). In the first screen against BARD1, we identified only truncating and frame-shift alterations (the truncation that deleted fewest residues removed amino acids from the C-terminal region of the peptide leaving aa 2â€“ 90), indicating that few or no single amino acid substitutions prevent BRCA1:BARD1 heterodimer formation in this system. We therefore conducted a third screen in which we selected mutations that inhibit the 600 Human Molecular Genetics, 2006, Vol. 15, No. 4 interaction with BARD1 using a strain optimized for highaffinity interactions (23). From this experiment eight missense variants in seven residues were identified (Fig. 1, line 2). We sought sequence information of patient variants from the literature (24,25) and from the BIC dataset. This carries BRCA1 sequence information from over 10 000 individuals, most with a personal or a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, hence it is a database that is enriched with deleterious mutations in BRCA1 (although the pathogenicity of the majority of individual variants is not known) (3). Comparison of the BRCA1 variants selected from the screens against the E2 and BARD1 with non-polymorphic variants encoded by patient DNA show that both interactions are inhibited by substitutions in residues that because of their co-ordination with structurally integral Zn2Ã¾ have been strongly predicted, or confirmed, to be involved in disease (Fig. 1, lines 1 â€“3). A further four selected variants from the E2 screen result in the substitution of residues altered in patient DNA in non-Zn2Ã¾-binding residues (Fig. 1), including the substitution of M18. The M18T/K missense variant has been identified in several independent families with breast and ovarian cancer (24,25). No variant identified in either screen is a known polymorphism. Hence, selection against either ubiquitin ligase cascade component, although interacting with BRCA1 at different affinities, identified substitutions of residues found altered in patient DNA, but only the E2 screen selected patient variants outside the structurally integral Zn2Ã¾-binding residues. The E2 component is more sensitive to BRCA1 patient missense variants As experimental selection against the BARD1 and the E2 interactions identified variants that correlated with patient variants, we next wished to test directly the relative sensitivities of each protein interaction to non-polymorphic missense substitutions in BRCA1 encoded by patient DNA. We therefore generated constructs of all variants encoded within the first 100 amino acids of BRCA1 logged in the BIC database; both those known to be disease-associated and those that are unclassified. (Where multiple substitutions of Zn2Ã¾-ligating cysteines have been reported, one variant was chosen; in addition M18K was generated (25).) These 35 variants were then tested for interaction with BARD1 and the E2 enzyme, UbcH5a, in a two-hybrid assay. Figure 2 shows that the wild-type BRCA1:BARD1 interaction was stronger than that of the BRCA1:E2 interaction as indicated by growth at high levels of the HIS3 competitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3AT) (Fig. 2A). A subset of BRCA1 missense substitutions inhibited growth with BARD1 at high 3AT concentrations (100 mM). These were mutations of Zn2Ã¾-binding residues, either previously confirmed or strongly expected to be pathogenic (C24R, C44F, C61G and to a lesser extent H41R and C39R). The E2:BRCA1 interaction was more sensitive to missense substitution, 16 variants showed no interaction with the E2 at the lowest concentration of 3AT (1 mM), with 21 BRCA1 variants failed to grow at 3 mM 3AT (Fig. 2A). All Zn2Ã¾- binding residue mutations inhibited the E2 interaction at 3 mM 3AT threshold and all patient variants that reduced the BARD1 interaction at a high threshold (100 mM 3AT), inhibited the E2 interaction at a lower one (1 mM 3AT). This was also the case for a non-patient mutation (L82D) selected for disruption of the BRCA1:BARD1 interaction (data not shown). Hence, we were unable to identify a missense mutation of BRCA1 that inhibited the BARD1 interaction, but that did not disrupt the interaction with the E2 enzyme. In a recent study, a combination of sequence alignment of BRCA1 orthologs and chemical difference of substitution was used to classify patient variants pathogenically (3). In the current study, seven of nine patient variants predicted to be deleterious using this approach inhibited the E2 interaction and all (five) variants predicted to be neutral, or of little significance, interacted with the E2 enzyme (Fig. 2C). (Experiments designed to test BRCA1 N-terminal homodimerization failed to reveal an interaction and we saw no interaction between BARD1 and UbcH5a (data not shown).) Loss of E2 interaction correlates with loss of BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity The sensitivity of the E2:BRCA1 interaction to missense substitution of BRCA1 suggested that the majority of nonpolymorphic missense variants reported in the population enriched for family or personal history of cancer might inhibit BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity, as confirmed breast cancer-associated missense variants do. In order to test this, we performed a biochemical assay which examined the ability of the BRCA1:BARD1 heterodimer to form ubiquitin Figure 1.

Substitutions classified as known mutations are shown in bold (BIC database and references (24,25)). Green-shaded boxes illustrate residues substituted in variants identified from the E2 (UbcH5a) and BARD1 screens that are located in residues also substituted in patient DNA. Human Molecular Genetics, 2006, Vol. 15, No. 4 601 chains in the presence of the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, UbcH5a. In this assay, co-purified wild-type BRCA1: BARD1 N-terminal complex was able to generate polyubiquitin chains and underwent extensive auto-ubiquitination (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Material, Fig. S2). Nineteen of the 35 BRCA1 variants co-purified with BARD1 showed reduced activity in the assay. As expected all seven mutations in Zn2Ã¾-ligating residues inhibited ubiquitin ligase activity and the activity of the remaining variants correlated with the BRCA1:E2 interaction (compare Fig. 2A with B, summarized in C). All variants that interacted with E2 at 10 mM 3AT had ubiquitin ligase activity and all but one that did not interact at this threshold showed no activity. The E2-binding activity of a single variant, with a helical substitution (I89T) correlates poorly with its ubiquitin ligase activity. It is possible that the E2 interaction is stabilized by the presence of BARD1 in the biochemical assay. The BRCA1:E2 interaction requires integrity of the BRCA1 N-terminus The BARD1 interaction was less sensitive to missense substitution of BRCA1 than the E2 interaction and restricted to the flanking helices that form the BRCA1:BARD1 interaction face (Q12Y, L82P) and the Zn2Ã¾-ligating residues of the RING (C39S/L, H41R, C44R, C47R and C61L) (Fig. 3H). However, the impact of these variants was measurable only at high concentrations of 3AT, or in a high threshold assay, suggesting that these mutations weaken the high-affinity BARD1:BRCA1 interaction. Conversely, the BRCA1 Figure 2. (A) BARD1 (amino acids 26â€“119) or full length E2 (UbcH5a), were tested for interaction with wild-type or variant BRCA1 (amino acids 2 â€“101), using yeast two-hybrid. Growth on media lacking histidine (-HIS) indicates protein:protein interaction leading to HIS3 transcription. Growth on increasing concentrations of the HIS3 competitive inhibitor 3AT indicates strong protein:protein interaction. Triangles represent serial dilutions of yeast. (B) His-tagged BRCA1 (amino acids 1â€“147) and BARD1 (amino acids 26â€“142) were co-purified from bacteria, and checked for parity before being subjected to substrateindependent ubiquitin ligase assay with the E2 (UbcH5a) enzyme. The I26A BRCA1 variant fails to bind the E2 enzyme and is ubiquitin ligase dead (20), and was included here as a negative control. Ub-mix indicates the inclusion of all components of the assay except BRCA1:BARD1 heterodimer. Several blots are spliced together to allow ease of comparison with (A). (Full blots with relevant controls are shown in Supplementary Material, Fig. S3.) The BRCA1: protein interaction and ubiquitin ligase data are summarized in (C) together with known (K) or predicted pathogenic status (3). Substitutions predicted to be deleterious (D), likely to be neutral or of little significance (N) or because of splice junction defect (S) (32) are shown. 602 Human Molecular Genetics, 2006, Vol. 15, No. 4 interaction with E2 was disrupted by many missense substitutions and at low 3AT concentrations. Modelling the BRCA1:E2 interaction on the solved RING E3:E2 complex of câ€“Cbl (shown in Fig. 3) and comparing it with the NMR solution structure of BRCA1:BARD1 reveals that the face between the RING-E3 and E2 (UbcH7) is not as extensive as the BRCA1:BARD1 interaction. The BARD1:BRCA1 interface is bigger (1337 versus 869 AËš 2 ), flatter and has a smaller gap volume, indicating that it is a tighter interaction. Both interactions have three hydrogen bonds but the BRCA1: BARD1 interaction also has two more salt bridges. Hence, single amino acid substitutions may be tolerated by the BRCA1:BARD1 interaction. Some of the amino acid substitutions of BRCA1 that inhibit the E2 interaction are located in the predicted E2 interface; in residues that co-ordinate with Zn2Ã¾ and that are within the central helix (Fig. 3C, E and H). However, the BRCA1:E2 interaction was also sensitive to non-E2 interface substitutions present within loops forming the cross-brace structure of the RING (Fig. 3D), at the join between the RING domain and flanking helices (Fig. 3F), as well as within the flanking helices (Fig. 3G). Substitutions that did not inhibit the E2 interaction are conservative in their nature (V11A, I15L, I21V, I42V, L87V), away from the E2 interface (D67E/Y, R71G, K38N) or in the distal portions of the a-helices (S4P, R7C, I90T, D96N, G98R and also Y105C, I124V and P142H (data not shown)) (illustrated in Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). Thus the locations and type of the majority of E2 disruptive variants Figure 3. Model of the BARD1:BRCA1:E2 (UbcH5b) complex.

Line 2 shows residues in the BRCA1:BARD1 interface (blue) (2) and residues identi- fied by Brzovic et al., (20) whose resonances are perturbed by the binding of the E2 (UbcH5c) and are therefore likely to make up the E2 interface (black). Line 3 summarizes all the E2 disruptive substitutions identified in the study, and Line 4 the BARD1 disruptive substitutions. Human Molecular Genetics, 2006, Vol. 15, No. 4 603 illustrate that the integrity of the BRCA1 RING domain, the flanking helices and the relationship between these elements are required for interaction with the E2 (Table 1). DISCUSSION The identification of several interacting proteins have suggested alternative functions for the BRCA1 N-terminal region (6 â€“10). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that this region participates in a function unrelated to ubiquitin ligase activity, in our hands BRCA1 N-terminal interactions with full length ATF, BAP1 and reported interacting regions of ER-alpha, MSH2 and p300/CBP could not be confirmed (data not shown). Data reported here correlate missense variants from individuals with a personal or family history of breast cancer with loss of E2 enzyme interaction and ubiquitin ligase activity. Selection from a randomly generated library of BRCA1 mutations for variants that inhibit the interaction with BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase components, BARD1 or the E2 enzyme, UbcH5a, identified substitutions in residues found altered in patient DNA. The majority of patient variants inhibited the E2 interaction, and mutations in Zn2Ã¾-binding residues reduced the already low-affinity BRCA1:E2 interaction (and weakened the high-affinity BRCA1:BARD1 interaction). Causal confirmation linking the loss of the BRCA1:E2 interaction with tumour susceptibility awaits further experiments where the subtle disruption of the E2 interaction, perhaps in an animal model, is shown to be tumourigenic. However, concordance of loss of BRCA1:E2-binding with variants confirmed or theoretically predicted to be pathogenic suggests that the BRCA1:E2 interaction may be an indicator of variant pathogenicity and may therefore form the basis of a functional assay. Further validation through investigation of BRCA1 families bearing currently unclassified variants, and continued reporting in public databases such as the BIC will be needed to confirm this for the purposes of diagnosis, counselling and clinical intervention. Our data are unable to dissect BARD1 from the E2 interaction as a cause of loss of ubiquitin ligase activity for the Zn2Ã¾-ligating residue class of mutations as these variants cause loss of binding to BARD1 and the E2 enzyme. This is presumably because of the deleterious impact these variants have on the N-terminal structure as a whole, preventing both correct folding of the RING domain and proper folding of the half helical bundle for high-affinity interaction with BARD1. Importantly, the inhibition of ubiquitin ligase activity, through loss of the E2 interaction, was not restricted to structurally detrimental mutations in Zn2Ã¾-ligating residues, Table 1.

The profile of BARD1 and E2 disruptive variants overlap; while E2 disruptive substitutions include Zn2Ã¾ residue binding mutants, they are also located throughout the N-terminal region, as are patient variants (Figs 1 and 3H). Our findings have revealed the fragility of the BRCA1:E2 interaction, which is sensitive to missense substitution in all elements of the BRCA1-N-terminus. The high density of missense variants in the BIC patient database in this region of BRCA1 may reflect a requirement for interaction with the E2 enzyme in tumour suppression. In cells, the formation of ubiquitin conjugates by exogenous BRCA1 is dependent both on BARD1 and on an intact BRCA1:E2-binding face, suggesting that loss of the E2 interaction alone is sufficient to inhibit BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity in cells (11). However, as substitution of Zn2Ã¾-binding residues are many times more frequent in patients than those elsewhere in the N-terminal region, it may be that the additional loss of interaction with BARD1, perhaps resulting in reduced BRCA1 protein stability (19,26), or loss of a further function, causes greater inhibition of BRCA1 tumour suppressor function, and more frequently results in tumourigenesis than loss of the E2 interaction alone. We speculate that a weak interaction between the E3 RING and its E2 component may be a necessary part of enzyme turnover in the generation of ubiquitin chains. The E3 RING:E2 interaction is a common biological interface, with more than 300 RING-bearing proteins in the human database, many of which may function as E3 ligases for ubiquitin or ubiquitin like molecules (27). Hence, if the conclusions made in relation to the BRCA1 RING:E2 interaction can be extrapolated to other RING:E2s, then we would expect perturbations in this interactive face to occur in other diseases and syndromes.\n",

       "            &lt;td class=&quot;fillremaining&quot; title=&quot;The tumor suppressor gene PTEN is frequently mutated in diverse human cancers and in autosomal dominant cancer predisposition disorders. Recent studies have shown that the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN is critical for its tumor suppressor function and that PTEN negatively regulates the phosphatidylinositol 3*-kinase-protein kinase B pathway. Although more than half of PTEN mutations result in protein truncation, a significant fraction of PTEN mutations are missense mutations. To examine whether tumor-derived and germ-line-derived missense mutations inactivate PTEN lipid phosphatase function, we constructed 42 distinct types of PTEN missense mutations and expressed them in Escherichia coli. The purified (His)6-tagged PTEN proteins were tested for their ability to dephosphorylate inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. In addition, we examined the effect of mutant PTENs on the ability of PTEN to bind to the phospholipid membrane. The results revealed that the majority of PTEN missense mutations [38 of 42 (90%)] eliminated or reduced phosphatase activity and that all of the mutations examined had no effect on the membrane binding activity of PTEN. Our study indicated that phosphoinositide phosphatase activity is important for the tumor suppressor function of PTEN and that there may be other mechanisms of PTEN inactivation that are not monitored by in vitro phosphatase assay and in vitro membrane binding assay. Introduction The PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 gene (referred to hereafter as PTEN) was identified recently as a putative tumor suppressor gene located on human chromosome 10q23.3 (1â€“3). Somatic deletions or small mutations of PTEN have been observed with high frequency in malignant glioma (4, 5) and endometrial cancer (6, 7) and at a lower rate in other malignancies such as prostate cancer (8), small cell lung cancer (9), melanoma (10), hepatocellular carcinoma (11), and breast cancer (12). Germ-line mutations of PTEN have been detected frequently (;80%) in the autosomal dominant hamartoma cancer syndromes Cowden disease (OMIM158350), Bannayan-Zonana syndrome (OMIM153480), and Lhermitte-Duclos disease (13, 14). In a murine model, heterozygous knockout mice develop tumors in multiple organs, whereas homozygous deletion of PTEN is embryonically lethal (15, 16). Furthermore, enforced expression of PTEN cDNA inhibits cell migration and spreading (17, 18) and suppresses tumor cell growth by arresting the cell cycle at G1 phase and/or by inducing apoptosis (19). This genetic and biological evidence suggests that PTEN has an important function in tumorigenesis as well as in normal embryonic development. The PTEN gene contains nine exons and encodes a 403-amino acid cytoplasmic protein showing extensive NH2-terminal homology with tensin and auxillin as well as having a central catalytic domain showing perfect homology with PTP3 and dual-specific phosphatases (1â€“3). A key step in understanding the function of PTEN as a tumor suppressor is to identify its physiological substrates. Data thus far suggest that PTEN possesses two distinct phosphatase activities. One is a phosphoinositide phosphatase activity against phosphoinositides, such as Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which involves dephosphorylation of the D3-position phosphate of the inositol ring (20). The other is protein phosphatase activity, including focal adhesion kinase (21). Several studies have shown that the phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of PTEN is critical for its tumor suppressor function, whereas activity toward the protein substrate is not essential for growth suppression (18, 22â€“25). This suggests that the former activity may play a more important role in tumor suppression by PTEN. Because PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is a phospholipid second messenger produced by PI3K, PTEN seems to be involved in the PI3K signaling pathway (26). One of the important downstream targets of PI3K is protein kinase B/Akt, which controls cell proliferation and protects cells from apoptosis (27). The fact that both PI3K and Akt play critical roles in a variety of growth factor signaling pathways raises the possibility that PTEN functions as a tumor suppressor through negative regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Loss of PTEN function can occur through homozygous gene deletion, point mutation plus loss of the remaining allele, or loss of expression (1, 2, 4, 28). We reviewed both somatic and germ-line PTEN mutations by surveying a database of the published literature. There were about 417 mutations reported by the end of August 1999. Among them, 143 (34%) were missense mutations including 90 distinct types, 162 (39%) were frameshift mutations, 73 (18%) were nonsense mutations, and 39 (9%) were other mutations containing in-frame deletion/insertion or splicing site mutations. The frequency of missense mutations in the PTEN gene was higher than that in other tumor suppressor genes except for the p53 gene, which had the highest frequency of missense mutations (;90%). Although both truncating and missense PTEN mutations were scattered throughout the nine exons of PTEN, the missense mutations tended to cluster around the phosphatase domain. In fact, several studies showed that a limited number of reported missense mutations within the phosphatase domain could abrogate the protein phosphatase and/or phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of PTEN (22, 25). Even so, the majority of missense mutations, including mutations outside the phosphatase doReceived 3/1/00; accepted 5/4/00.

In general, analyses of the effects of missense mutations derived from a disease on the functional properties of the gene product are advantageous to elucidate the most important function for pathogenesis. Therefore, we evaluated the pathogenic effect of a series of PTEN missense mutations. In this study, we constructed 42 distinct missense mutations that mapped within the PTEN open reading frame and examined the phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of the (His)6-tagged PTEN protein corresponding to each point mutation against Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 as well as their ability to bind a phospholipid membrane in vitro. Materials and Methods Vector Construction and Cloning of Mutant PTEN Alleles. The wildtype histidine-tagged PTEN [(His)6-PTEN] expression vector was constructed as follows. The full-length open reading frame of PTEN cDNA was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and a pair of primers with BamHI and HindIII sites. The restriction endonuclease-treated PCR product was inserted into the BamHI/HindIII sites of the pQE30 vector (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). PTEN cDNA with missense mutations (S10N, Y16C, G20E, Y27S, L42R, H61R, Y68H, C71Y, H93Y, C105F, D107Y, L112P, L112R, A121P, C124R, G129R, G129E, R130G, R130L, R130Q, V133I, M134L, C136Y, Y155C, G165R, S170N, S170R, R173C, R173H, R173P, Y174N, S227F, G251C, K289E, D331G, F341V, K342N, V343E, L345Q, F347L, V369G, and T401I) was constructed by megaprimer PCR (29). The BamHI/HindIII fragment of mutant PTEN cDNA was introduced into the BamHI/HindIII site of the pQE30 vector to generate mutant (His)6-PTEN expression vectors. All of the plasmids were sequenced to confirm that the appropriate mutation had been incorporated and that no additional mutations were present. These vectors are identical to the wild-type (His)6-PTEN expression vector except for the specific mutations. Bacterial Expression and Purification of PTEN. To induce the expression of (His)6-PTEN, the vector was transformed into Escherichia coli strain M15 harboring pREP4 (Qiagen). The resulting transformant was cultured in 50 ml of Luria-Bertani medium at 37Â°C by mid-log phase (A600 nm 5 0.6). Isopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added at a concentration of 0.2 mM, and the culture was incubated for an additional 6 h at 25Â°C. Thereafter, all of the procedures were performed at 4Â°C. The bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the bacterial pellet was frozen at 280Â°C until use. The frozen pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and bacteriolysis was performed by sonication until the cell suspension became transparent. After the addition of 10 ml of Tween 20, the lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 3 g for 20 min. The supernatant was mixed with 50 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 30 min at 4Â°C; washed three times with 250 ml of the wash buffer containing 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole; and eluted three times with 50 ml of the elution buffer containing 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole. The buffer of the eluted solution was then replaced with 500 ml of TED buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by using Nanosep (Pall Filtron, Northborough, MA) and centrifuged to a volume of 50 ml. The purified protein was stored in the presence of 2% (v/v) glycerin at 280Â°C until use. Protein concentrations and the integrity of fusion proteins were determined by SDSPAGE and by comparison with known concentrations of BSA. Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 Phosphatase Assay. The inositol phosphatase assay was performed using the method described by Maehama and Dixon (20) in a 20-ml reaction volume consisting of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM DTT, 60 mM [ 3 H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (0.01 mCi; New England Nuclear, Boston, MA), and 1 mg of the purified (His)6-PTEN protein at 37Â°C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of stop solution consisting of 0.1 M HCOOH and 0.6 M HCOONH4. To separate the dephosphorylated product [ 3 H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 from the substrate, the reaction sample was applied to a AG1-X8 column (0.5 ml; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), equilibrated with the stop solution, and eluted with 5 ml of the stop solution. Radioactivity in the eluted solution was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 Phosphatase Assay. The (His)6-PTEN protein used for the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase assay was extracted again as described above, except that NaH2PO4 was replaced with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) in the buffer used for lysis, washing, and elution. The phosphatase assays (30) were performed in 50 ml of reaction buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM DTT, 200 mM water-soluble DiC8-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Echelon, Salt Lake City, UT), and 2 mg of (His)6-PTEN protein at 37Â°C for 40 min. The phosphate released from the substrate was measured using Green Reagent (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. In brief, 500 ml of Green Reagent were added, followed by incubation for 20 min at room temperature. The concentration of the released phosphate was determined by measuring the A620 nm. A standard curve was generated in each assay, and the amount of free phosphate was calculated from the standard curve line-fit data. Phospholipid Binding Assay. The PTEN protein binding to LMVs consisting of three different phosphoglycerides, PS, PE, and PC (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), was carried out according to the procedures published previously (31â€“ 33), with some modifications. Briefly, 100 mg of LMVs (PS:PE:PC ratio, 35:50:15) were prepared in 10 ml of buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2) and 100 mM NaCl by sonication and collected by centrifugation. An aliquot of (His)6-PTEN protein (2â€“5 mg) and 100 ml of LMVs were incubated in 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2) and 2 mM CaCl2 for 15 min at 25Â°C. After centrifugation at 12,000 3 g for 10 min at 4Â°C, the pellets containing lipid and bound proteins were washed in 500 ml of the above-mentioned buffer and dissolved in SDS sample buffer. The addition of an equal volume of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid precipitated the proteins in the supernatants. After a 15-min incubation on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 3 g for 15 min at 4Â°C, washed twice with acetone, and mixed with SDS sample buffer. Equal proportions of the supernatants and pellets were analyzed by 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Daiichi Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan). Results To examine whether the missense mutation inactivates the phosphoinositide phosphatase function of PTEN, we selected 42 distinct tumor-derived or germ-line-derived missense mutations covering more than 40% of the reported missense mutation types. Each mutation was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed as a (His)6-tagged fusion protein [(His)6-PTEN] in E. coli, and purified as described in â€œMaterials and Methods.â€� The amount of expressed (His)6-PTEN was measured by spectrophotometer and confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The representative data are shown in Fig. 1. To assess phosphoinositide phosphatase activity, we used two phosphoinositide substrates with [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] or without [Ins(1,3,4,5)P4] a diacylglycerol chain. Bacterially expressed PTEN has been shown to dephosphorylate the phosphate in the D3 position of the inositol ring in each substrate (20, 30, 33).

Â© 2000 American Association for Cancer Research. phatase activity against Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, (His)6-PTEN harboring the indicated amino acid substitutions was assayed for its ability to dephosphorylate the phosphate in the D3 position of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 using the method described previously (Ref. 20; Fig. 2). The results showed that four mutant PTENs (9%; S10N, L42R, V369G, and T401I) retained activity comparable with or even higher than that of normal PTEN, and seven mutant PTENs (17%; G20E, M134L, S227F, K289E, D331G, K342N, and F347L) retained partial activity (Fig. 2). The remaining 31 mutant PTENs (74%) had no activity. Phosphatase Activities of PTEN against PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Because Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 lacks the diacylglycerol chain of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, we compared the phosphoinositide phosphatase activities of 12 selected mutant PTENs and normal PTEN toward the two substrates. These PTENs contained mutants with full (S10N, L42R, V369G, and T401I), partial (G20E, M134L, S227F, and K342N), and no (Y68H, G129E, R130G, and R173C) phosphatase activities against Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. Water-soluble PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was used to examine the released phosphate. The eight mutant PTENs with full or partial Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 phosphatase activity showed nearly the same level of phosphatase activity against PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 as wild-type PTEN, whereas the four mutant PTENs with no Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 phosphatase activity also eliminated PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase activity (Fig. 3). These results indicated that the effects of the missense mutations on PTEN phosphatase activity against the two phosphoinositides were nearly identical, although the assay using Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 may be more sensitive to subtle structural changes in PTEN than that using PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Ability of PTEN to Bind to LMVs. During our study of PTEN phosphatase activities, a second biochemical property of PTEN was reported: the ability to bind to lipid membranes in vitro through the C2 domain (33). This raised the possibility that some PTEN mutations may inactivate the physiological function of PTEN through disruption Fig. 3. Phosphatase activity of PTEN against PtdIns(3,4,5) P3. Two mg of (His)6-PTEN were assayed for phosphoinositol phosphatase activity against water-soluble diC8- PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The amount of free phosphate released in the reaction was measured at A620 nm and compared with a standard curve. The data are representative of three experiments that yielded similar results. Fig. 2. Phosphatase activity of PTEN against Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. One mg of (His)6-PTEN protein was assayed for phosphoinositol phosphatase activity against [3 H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 as described in â€œMaterials and Methods.â€� The radioactivity of the dephosphorylated product was counted, and the results were normalized to wild-type PTEN (100%). The 42 PTEN mutants were divided into seven groups (A2G) for protein extraction and phosphatase assay. The data are representative of three independent experiments that yielded similar results. 3149 FUNCTIONAL EVALUATION OF PTEN MISSENSE MUTATIONS Downloaded from cancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 28, 2017. Â© 2000 American Association for Cancer Research. of the membrane binding activity. To examine this possibility, 15 mutant PTENs with (S10N, L42R, K289E, D331G, V369G, and T401I) or without (Y16C, Y68H, R130Q, R130L, G165R, S170N, R173C, G251C, and L345Q) phosphatase activity were subjected to a protein-membrane binding assay using LMVs that consisted of three different phosphoglycerides (PC, PS, and PE) according to procedures published previously (31, 32). Representative data of the selected mutant PTENs are shown in Fig. 4. When bacterial proteins copurified with PTEN failed to bind LMVs, all mutants tested retained the binding activity of PTEN, irrespective of whether or not they had phosphoinositide phosphatase activity. This result suggested that the ability of PTEN to bind to membranes is not a major target of tumor-derived or germ-line-derived missense mutations, even if the activity may be important for physiological PTEN function. Discussion Since its discovery, PTEN has been thought to be a protein phosphatase because it shares the signature motif HCXXGXXR with the active site of PTPs and dual-specific protein phosphatases. However, recent studies have shown that the biologically relevant targets of PTEN may not be phosphoproteins but rather a subset of phosphoinositides (20, 22, 25). This speculation can be supported by several findings. For example, tumor cell lines with mutant PTEN retained elevated levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and Akt activity, and the introduction of wild-type PTEN reduced the levels of both (34, 35). Furthermore, analysis of the PTEN crystal structure indicated that the phosphatase active site of PTEN is larger than that of the PTPs and that the COOH-terminal portion has a structure similar to the C2 domain and actually binds to phospholipid membranes in vitro (33). To elucidate the most important tumor suppressor function of PTEN, the analysis of the effect of the missense mutations on currently known functional properties of PTEN will be beneficial until all of the functions of PTEN are clarified. Thus far, only a limited number of tumor-derived and germ-line-derived PTEN missense mutations have been examined for known PTEN functions. All of the missense mutations that have been tested inactivated phosphoinositide phosphatase activity, whereas some of the mutations retained protein phosphatase activity (22, 25). Although these observations stressed the importance of phosphoinositide phosphatase activity, it was necessary to determine whether the reported PTEN missense mutations inactivate the currently proposed functions of PTEN. As an initial study, we constructed 42 missense mutations, which covered more than 40% of reported missense mutations, mapped throughout from the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal portions of PTEN and tested them against the phosphoinositide phosphatase activity and membrane binding activity of wild-type PTEN. We classified them according to the recent report describing PTEN crystal structure (33). There were 31 mutations (S10N, Y16C, G20E, Y27S, L42R, H61R, Y68H, C71Y, H93Y, C105F, D107Y, L112P, L112R, A121P, C124R, G129R, G129E, R130G, R130L, R130Q, V133I, M134L, C136Y, Y155C, G165R, S170N, S170R, R173C, R173H, R173P, and Y174N) within the NH2-terminal phosphatase domain (residues 7â€“185), 9 mutations (S227F, G251C, K289E, D331G, F341V, K342N, V343E, L345Q, and F347L) within the COOHterminal C2 domain (residues 186â€“351), and 2 mutations (V369G and T401I) close to the COOH-terminal end. Among these mutations, most of the mutations within the NH2-terminal phosphatase domain (27 of 31 mutations, 87%) inactivated phosphatase activity. In contrast, a higher percentage of mutations within both the C2 domain (five of nine mutations, 56%) and the COOH-terminal end (two of two mutations, 100%) retained phosphatase activity. Overall, our results showed that most mutations (38 of 42 mutations, 90%) eliminated or reduced phosphatase activity. The mutations within the phosphatase domain contain eight mutations located at the predicted active site pocket, including six mutations (C124R, G129R, G129E, R130G, R130L, and R130Q) in the HCXXGRXXR signature motif of the P loop (residues 123â€“130) at the bottom of the pocket and two mutations (H93Y and G165R) at the walls of the pocket, the WPD loop (residues 90â€“97), and the TI loop (residues 160â€“168), respectively. All mutations within the active site pocket eliminated phosphatase activity. The mutations in the motif represent 19% (27 of 143) of the total missense mutations according to our statistics. From our functional analysis and the previous genetic and structural analyses, we conclude that PTEN phosphoinositide phosphatase activity is an important tumor-suppressive function of PTEN. However, 26% (11 of 42) of the mutants retained some level of the normal PTEN phosphatase activity in vitro. Although there may be a polymorphism(s) among these mutants, it is likely that the in vitro phosphatase assays do not always reflect the in vivo phosphatase activity of PTEN and that there might be other mechanisms of PTEN inactivation. In our study, most of the mutations that mapped to the COOH-terminal region retained some levels of phosphoinositide phosphatase activity. According to recent studies, there may be regulatory domains in the COOH-terminal region. Georgescu et al. (30) have shown that two missense mutations (L345Q and T348I) in the predicted b-strand structure (residues 342â€“349) seem to destabilize PTEN in mammalian cells, although these mutations are also defective in the phosphatase assay by bacterially expressed proteins. Lee et al. (33) have shown that the predicted C2 domain in the COOHterminal portion bound to phospholipid membranes. They also speculated that the C2 and the phosphatase domains associate across an extensive interface adjacent to the phosphatase active site. Furthermore, they predicted that the C2 domain may not only recruit PTEN to the membrane but may also help with the positioning and orientation of the catalytic domain with respect to the membrane-bound substrate. In this study, we could not find any tumor-derived mutations that affected the membrane binding activity of PTEN, which suggested that the binding of PTEN to membranes is not a major target of the missense mutations. Our results do not exclude the possibility of binding activity as an important tumor suppressor function of PTEN because there are high frequencies of PTEN frameshift (39%) and nonsense (18%) mutations that are predicted to eliminate the PTEN membrane binding domain and perhaps preserve enzyme activity. It would be of great interest to determine whether the mutations in the C2 domain, which have both in vitro phosphatase and membrane binding activities, affect the phosphatase activity under the conditions of PTEN protein binding to the phospholipid membrane. PTEN also has another domain, called the PDZ binding domain, in the COOH-terminal end (33, 36); the domain binds to the PDZ proteins (DLG1 and MAST205), and this binding is regulated by phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue at codon 401. It would also be Fig. 4. PTEN binding activity to LMVs. A representative silver-stained gel of protein bound to LMVs is shown. P, the pellet fraction coprecipitated with LMVs.

Finally, we found that some mutants with partial phosphatase activity against Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (G20E, M134L, S227F, and K342N) showed nearly wild-type levels of phosphatase activity against PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. It is possible that certain PTEN mutations impair phosphatase activity only toward one type of inositol phosphate molecule [Ins(1,3,4,5)P4] but not others [i.e., PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] and therefore affect distinct cellular signaling pathways because these two molecules have different functions in the cell: Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 is a second messenger involved in regulating intracellular calcium signaling, whereas PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is well known as a second messenger molecule generated by PI3K activity (20). Taken together, PTEN phosphatase activity could be regulated by subcellular location, phosphorylation, and/or interaction with other cellular proteins. The physiological function of PTEN remains to be clarified in additional experiments.&quot;&gt;\n",
       "                The tumor suppressor gene PTEN is frequently mutated in diverse human cancers and in autosomal dominant cancer predisposition disorders. Recent studies have shown that the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN is critical for its tumor suppressor function and that PTEN negatively regulates the phosphatidylinositol 3*-kinase-protein kinase B pathway. Although more than half of PTEN mutations result in protein truncation, a significant fraction of PTEN mutations are missense mutations. To examine whether tumor-derived and germ-line-derived missense mutations inactivate PTEN lipid phosphatase function, we constructed 42 distinct types of PTEN missense mutations and expressed them in Escherichia coli. The purified (His)6-tagged PTEN proteins were tested for their ability to dephosphorylate inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. In addition, we examined the effect of mutant PTENs on the ability of PTEN to bind to the phospholipid membrane. The results revealed that the majority of PTEN missense mutations [38 of 42 (90%)] eliminated or reduced phosphatase activity and that all of the mutations examined had no effect on the membrane binding activity of PTEN. Our study indicated that phosphoinositide phosphatase activity is important for the tumor suppressor function of PTEN and that there may be other mechanisms of PTEN inactivation that are not monitored by in vitro phosphatase assay and in vitro membrane binding assay. Introduction The PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 gene (referred to hereafter as PTEN) was identified recently as a putative tumor suppressor gene located on human chromosome 10q23.3 (1â€“3). Somatic deletions or small mutations of PTEN have been observed with high frequency in malignant glioma (4, 5) and endometrial cancer (6, 7) and at a lower rate in other malignancies such as prostate cancer (8), small cell lung cancer (9), melanoma (10), hepatocellular carcinoma (11), and breast cancer (12). Germ-line mutations of PTEN have been detected frequently (;80%) in the autosomal dominant hamartoma cancer syndromes Cowden disease (OMIM158350), Bannayan-Zonana syndrome (OMIM153480), and Lhermitte-Duclos disease (13, 14). In a murine model, heterozygous knockout mice develop tumors in multiple organs, whereas homozygous deletion of PTEN is embryonically lethal (15, 16). Furthermore, enforced expression of PTEN cDNA inhibits cell migration and spreading (17, 18) and suppresses tumor cell growth by arresting the cell cycle at G1 phase and/or by inducing apoptosis (19). This genetic and biological evidence suggests that PTEN has an important function in tumorigenesis as well as in normal embryonic development. The PTEN gene contains nine exons and encodes a 403-amino acid cytoplasmic protein showing extensive NH2-terminal homology with tensin and auxillin as well as having a central catalytic domain showing perfect homology with PTP3 and dual-specific phosphatases (1â€“3). A key step in understanding the function of PTEN as a tumor suppressor is to identify its physiological substrates. Data thus far suggest that PTEN possesses two distinct phosphatase activities. One is a phosphoinositide phosphatase activity against phosphoinositides, such as Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which involves dephosphorylation of the D3-position phosphate of the inositol ring (20). The other is protein phosphatase activity, including focal adhesion kinase (21). Several studies have shown that the phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of PTEN is critical for its tumor suppressor function, whereas activity toward the protein substrate is not essential for growth suppression (18, 22â€“25). This suggests that the former activity may play a more important role in tumor suppression by PTEN. Because PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is a phospholipid second messenger produced by PI3K, PTEN seems to be involved in the PI3K signaling pathway (26). One of the important downstream targets of PI3K is protein kinase B/Akt, which controls cell proliferation and protects cells from apoptosis (27). The fact that both PI3K and Akt play critical roles in a variety of growth factor signaling pathways raises the possibility that PTEN functions as a tumor suppressor through negative regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Loss of PTEN function can occur through homozygous gene deletion, point mutation plus loss of the remaining allele, or loss of expression (1, 2, 4, 28). We reviewed both somatic and germ-line PTEN mutations by surveying a database of the published literature. There were about 417 mutations reported by the end of August 1999. Among them, 143 (34%) were missense mutations including 90 distinct types, 162 (39%) were frameshift mutations, 73 (18%) were nonsense mutations, and 39 (9%) were other mutations containing in-frame deletion/insertion or splicing site mutations. The frequency of missense mutations in the PTEN gene was higher than that in other tumor suppressor genes except for the p53 gene, which had the highest frequency of missense mutations (;90%). Although both truncating and missense PTEN mutations were scattered throughout the nine exons of PTEN, the missense mutations tended to cluster around the phosphatase domain. In fact, several studies showed that a limited number of reported missense mutations within the phosphatase domain could abrogate the protein phosphatase and/or phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of PTEN (22, 25). Even so, the majority of missense mutations, including mutations outside the phosphatase doReceived 3/1/00; accepted 5/4/00.

In general, analyses of the effects of missense mutations derived from a disease on the functional properties of the gene product are advantageous to elucidate the most important function for pathogenesis. Therefore, we evaluated the pathogenic effect of a series of PTEN missense mutations. In this study, we constructed 42 distinct missense mutations that mapped within the PTEN open reading frame and examined the phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of the (His)6-tagged PTEN protein corresponding to each point mutation against Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 as well as their ability to bind a phospholipid membrane in vitro. Materials and Methods Vector Construction and Cloning of Mutant PTEN Alleles. The wildtype histidine-tagged PTEN [(His)6-PTEN] expression vector was constructed as follows. The full-length open reading frame of PTEN cDNA was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and a pair of primers with BamHI and HindIII sites. The restriction endonuclease-treated PCR product was inserted into the BamHI/HindIII sites of the pQE30 vector (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). PTEN cDNA with missense mutations (S10N, Y16C, G20E, Y27S, L42R, H61R, Y68H, C71Y, H93Y, C105F, D107Y, L112P, L112R, A121P, C124R, G129R, G129E, R130G, R130L, R130Q, V133I, M134L, C136Y, Y155C, G165R, S170N, S170R, R173C, R173H, R173P, Y174N, S227F, G251C, K289E, D331G, F341V, K342N, V343E, L345Q, F347L, V369G, and T401I) was constructed by megaprimer PCR (29). The BamHI/HindIII fragment of mutant PTEN cDNA was introduced into the BamHI/HindIII site of the pQE30 vector to generate mutant (His)6-PTEN expression vectors. All of the plasmids were sequenced to confirm that the appropriate mutation had been incorporated and that no additional mutations were present. These vectors are identical to the wild-type (His)6-PTEN expression vector except for the specific mutations. Bacterial Expression and Purification of PTEN. To induce the expression of (His)6-PTEN, the vector was transformed into Escherichia coli strain M15 harboring pREP4 (Qiagen). The resulting transformant was cultured in 50 ml of Luria-Bertani medium at 37Â°C by mid-log phase (A600 nm 5 0.6). Isopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added at a concentration of 0.2 mM, and the culture was incubated for an additional 6 h at 25Â°C. Thereafter, all of the procedures were performed at 4Â°C. The bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the bacterial pellet was frozen at 280Â°C until use. The frozen pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and bacteriolysis was performed by sonication until the cell suspension became transparent. After the addition of 10 ml of Tween 20, the lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 3 g for 20 min. The supernatant was mixed with 50 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 30 min at 4Â°C; washed three times with 250 ml of the wash buffer containing 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole; and eluted three times with 50 ml of the elution buffer containing 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole. The buffer of the eluted solution was then replaced with 500 ml of TED buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by using Nanosep (Pall Filtron, Northborough, MA) and centrifuged to a volume of 50 ml. The purified protein was stored in the presence of 2% (v/v) glycerin at 280Â°C until use. Protein concentrations and the integrity of fusion proteins were determined by SDSPAGE and by comparison with known concentrations of BSA. Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 Phosphatase Assay. The inositol phosphatase assay was performed using the method described by Maehama and Dixon (20) in a 20-ml reaction volume consisting of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM DTT, 60 mM [ 3 H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (0.01 mCi; New England Nuclear, Boston, MA), and 1 mg of the purified (His)6-PTEN protein at 37Â°C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of stop solution consisting of 0.1 M HCOOH and 0.6 M HCOONH4. To separate the dephosphorylated product [ 3 H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 from the substrate, the reaction sample was applied to a AG1-X8 column (0.5 ml; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), equilibrated with the stop solution, and eluted with 5 ml of the stop solution. Radioactivity in the eluted solution was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 Phosphatase Assay. The (His)6-PTEN protein used for the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase assay was extracted again as described above, except that NaH2PO4 was replaced with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) in the buffer used for lysis, washing, and elution. The phosphatase assays (30) were performed in 50 ml of reaction buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM DTT, 200 mM water-soluble DiC8-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Echelon, Salt Lake City, UT), and 2 mg of (His)6-PTEN protein at 37Â°C for 40 min. The phosphate released from the substrate was measured using Green Reagent (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. In brief, 500 ml of Green Reagent were added, followed by incubation for 20 min at room temperature. The concentration of the released phosphate was determined by measuring the A620 nm. A standard curve was generated in each assay, and the amount of free phosphate was calculated from the standard curve line-fit data. Phospholipid Binding Assay. The PTEN protein binding to LMVs consisting of three different phosphoglycerides, PS, PE, and PC (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), was carried out according to the procedures published previously (31â€“ 33), with some modifications. Briefly, 100 mg of LMVs (PS:PE:PC ratio, 35:50:15) were prepared in 10 ml of buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2) and 100 mM NaCl by sonication and collected by centrifugation. An aliquot of (His)6-PTEN protein (2â€“5 mg) and 100 ml of LMVs were incubated in 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2) and 2 mM CaCl2 for 15 min at 25Â°C. After centrifugation at 12,000 3 g for 10 min at 4Â°C, the pellets containing lipid and bound proteins were washed in 500 ml of the above-mentioned buffer and dissolved in SDS sample buffer. The addition of an equal volume of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid precipitated the proteins in the supernatants. After a 15-min incubation on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 3 g for 15 min at 4Â°C, washed twice with acetone, and mixed with SDS sample buffer. Equal proportions of the supernatants and pellets were analyzed by 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Daiichi Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan). Results To examine whether the missense mutation inactivates the phosphoinositide phosphatase function of PTEN, we selected 42 distinct tumor-derived or germ-line-derived missense mutations covering more than 40% of the reported missense mutation types. Each mutation was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed as a (His)6-tagged fusion protein [(His)6-PTEN] in E. coli, and purified as described in â€œMaterials and Methods.â€� The amount of expressed (His)6-PTEN was measured by spectrophotometer and confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The representative data are shown in Fig. 1. To assess phosphoinositide phosphatase activity, we used two phosphoinositide substrates with [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] or without [Ins(1,3,4,5)P4] a diacylglycerol chain. Bacterially expressed PTEN has been shown to dephosphorylate the phosphate in the D3 position of the inositol ring in each substrate (20, 30, 33). Phosphatase Activities of PTEN against Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. To examine whether the missense mutations inactivate normal PTEN phosFig. 1. Bacterial expression and purification of PTEN. Recombinant (His)6-PTEN expressed from wild-type PTEN, null pQE30 vector, and mutant PTEN (Y68H, S170N, G251C, K289E, D331G, and L345Q) in E. coli was purified using Ni-NTA-agarose, as described in â€œMaterials and Methods.â€� Approximately 0.5â€“1 mg of the proteins was separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. BSA was used for judging the concentration of the PTEN protein.

Â© 2000 American Association for Cancer Research. phatase activity against Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, (His)6-PTEN harboring the indicated amino acid substitutions was assayed for its ability to dephosphorylate the phosphate in the D3 position of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 using the method described previously (Ref. 20; Fig. 2). The results showed that four mutant PTENs (9%; S10N, L42R, V369G, and T401I) retained activity comparable with or even higher than that of normal PTEN, and seven mutant PTENs (17%; G20E, M134L, S227F, K289E, D331G, K342N, and F347L) retained partial activity (Fig. 2). The remaining 31 mutant PTENs (74%) had no activity. Phosphatase Activities of PTEN against PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Because Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 lacks the diacylglycerol chain of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, we compared the phosphoinositide phosphatase activities of 12 selected mutant PTENs and normal PTEN toward the two substrates. These PTENs contained mutants with full (S10N, L42R, V369G, and T401I), partial (G20E, M134L, S227F, and K342N), and no (Y68H, G129E, R130G, and R173C) phosphatase activities against Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. Water-soluble PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was used to examine the released phosphate. The eight mutant PTENs with full or partial Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 phosphatase activity showed nearly the same level of phosphatase activity against PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 as wild-type PTEN, whereas the four mutant PTENs with no Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 phosphatase activity also eliminated PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase activity (Fig. 3). These results indicated that the effects of the missense mutations on PTEN phosphatase activity against the two phosphoinositides were nearly identical, although the assay using Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 may be more sensitive to subtle structural changes in PTEN than that using PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Ability of PTEN to Bind to LMVs. During our study of PTEN phosphatase activities, a second biochemical property of PTEN was reported: the ability to bind to lipid membranes in vitro through the C2 domain (33). This raised the possibility that some PTEN mutations may inactivate the physiological function of PTEN through disruption Fig. 3. Phosphatase activity of PTEN against PtdIns(3,4,5) P3. Two mg of (His)6-PTEN were assayed for phosphoinositol phosphatase activity against water-soluble diC8- PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The amount of free phosphate released in the reaction was measured at A620 nm and compared with a standard curve. The data are representative of three experiments that yielded similar results. Fig. 2. Phosphatase activity of PTEN against Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. One mg of (His)6-PTEN protein was assayed for phosphoinositol phosphatase activity against [3 H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 as described in â€œMaterials and Methods.â€� The radioactivity of the dephosphorylated product was counted, and the results were normalized to wild-type PTEN (100%). The 42 PTEN mutants were divided into seven groups (A2G) for protein extraction and phosphatase assay. The data are representative of three independent experiments that yielded similar results. 3149 FUNCTIONAL EVALUATION OF PTEN MISSENSE MUTATIONS Downloaded from cancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 28, 2017.

To examine this possibility, 15 mutant PTENs with (S10N, L42R, K289E, D331G, V369G, and T401I) or without (Y16C, Y68H, R130Q, R130L, G165R, S170N, R173C, G251C, and L345Q) phosphatase activity were subjected to a protein-membrane binding assay using LMVs that consisted of three different phosphoglycerides (PC, PS, and PE) according to procedures published previously (31, 32). Representative data of the selected mutant PTENs are shown in Fig. 4. When bacterial proteins copurified with PTEN failed to bind LMVs, all mutants tested retained the binding activity of PTEN, irrespective of whether or not they had phosphoinositide phosphatase activity. This result suggested that the ability of PTEN to bind to membranes is not a major target of tumor-derived or germ-line-derived missense mutations, even if the activity may be important for physiological PTEN function. Discussion Since its discovery, PTEN has been thought to be a protein phosphatase because it shares the signature motif HCXXGXXR with the active site of PTPs and dual-specific protein phosphatases. However, recent studies have shown that the biologically relevant targets of PTEN may not be phosphoproteins but rather a subset of phosphoinositides (20, 22, 25). This speculation can be supported by several findings. For example, tumor cell lines with mutant PTEN retained elevated levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and Akt activity, and the introduction of wild-type PTEN reduced the levels of both (34, 35). Furthermore, analysis of the PTEN crystal structure indicated that the phosphatase active site of PTEN is larger than that of the PTPs and that the COOH-terminal portion has a structure similar to the C2 domain and actually binds to phospholipid membranes in vitro (33). To elucidate the most important tumor suppressor function of PTEN, the analysis of the effect of the missense mutations on currently known functional properties of PTEN will be beneficial until all of the functions of PTEN are clarified. Thus far, only a limited number of tumor-derived and germ-line-derived PTEN missense mutations have been examined for known PTEN functions. All of the missense mutations that have been tested inactivated phosphoinositide phosphatase activity, whereas some of the mutations retained protein phosphatase activity (22, 25). Although these observations stressed the importance of phosphoinositide phosphatase activity, it was necessary to determine whether the reported PTEN missense mutations inactivate the currently proposed functions of PTEN. As an initial study, we constructed 42 missense mutations, which covered more than 40% of reported missense mutations, mapped throughout from the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal portions of PTEN and tested them against the phosphoinositide phosphatase activity and membrane binding activity of wild-type PTEN. We classified them according to the recent report describing PTEN crystal structure (33). There were 31 mutations (S10N, Y16C, G20E, Y27S, L42R, H61R, Y68H, C71Y, H93Y, C105F, D107Y, L112P, L112R, A121P, C124R, G129R, G129E, R130G, R130L, R130Q, V133I, M134L, C136Y, Y155C, G165R, S170N, S170R, R173C, R173H, R173P, and Y174N) within the NH2-terminal phosphatase domain (residues 7â€“185), 9 mutations (S227F, G251C, K289E, D331G, F341V, K342N, V343E, L345Q, and F347L) within the COOHterminal C2 domain (residues 186â€“351), and 2 mutations (V369G and T401I) close to the COOH-terminal end. Among these mutations, most of the mutations within the NH2-terminal phosphatase domain (27 of 31 mutations, 87%) inactivated phosphatase activity. In contrast, a higher percentage of mutations within both the C2 domain (five of nine mutations, 56%) and the COOH-terminal end (two of two mutations, 100%) retained phosphatase activity. Overall, our results showed that most mutations (38 of 42 mutations, 90%) eliminated or reduced phosphatase activity. The mutations within the phosphatase domain contain eight mutations located at the predicted active site pocket, including six mutations (C124R, G129R, G129E, R130G, R130L, and R130Q) in the HCXXGRXXR signature motif of the P loop (residues 123â€“130) at the bottom of the pocket and two mutations (H93Y and G165R) at the walls of the pocket, the WPD loop (residues 90â€“97), and the TI loop (residues 160â€“168), respectively. All mutations within the active site pocket eliminated phosphatase activity. The mutations in the motif represent 19% (27 of 143) of the total missense mutations according to our statistics. From our functional analysis and the previous genetic and structural analyses, we conclude that PTEN phosphoinositide phosphatase activity is an important tumor-suppressive function of PTEN. However, 26% (11 of 42) of the mutants retained some level of the normal PTEN phosphatase activity in vitro. Although there may be a polymorphism(s) among these mutants, it is likely that the in vitro phosphatase assays do not always reflect the in vivo phosphatase activity of PTEN and that there might be other mechanisms of PTEN inactivation. In our study, most of the mutations that mapped to the COOH-terminal region retained some levels of phosphoinositide phosphatase activity. According to recent studies, there may be regulatory domains in the COOH-terminal region. Georgescu et al. (30) have shown that two missense mutations (L345Q and T348I) in the predicted b-strand structure (residues 342â€“349) seem to destabilize PTEN in mammalian cells, although these mutations are also defective in the phosphatase assay by bacterially expressed proteins. Lee et al. (33) have shown that the predicted C2 domain in the COOHterminal portion bound to phospholipid membranes. They also speculated that the C2 and the phosphatase domains associate across an extensive interface adjacent to the phosphatase active site. Furthermore, they predicted that the C2 domain may not only recruit PTEN to the membrane but may also help with the positioning and orientation of the catalytic domain with respect to the membrane-bound substrate. In this study, we could not find any tumor-derived mutations that affected the membrane binding activity of PTEN, which suggested that the binding of PTEN to membranes is not a major target of the missense mutations. Our results do not exclude the possibility of binding activity as an important tumor suppressor function of PTEN because there are high frequencies of PTEN frameshift (39%) and nonsense (18%) mutations that are predicted to eliminate the PTEN membrane binding domain and perhaps preserve enzyme activity. It would be of great interest to determine whether the mutations in the C2 domain, which have both in vitro phosphatase and membrane binding activities, affect the phosphatase activity under the conditions of PTEN protein binding to the phospholipid membrane. PTEN also has another domain, called the PDZ binding domain, in the COOH-terminal end (33, 36); the domain binds to the PDZ proteins (DLG1 and MAST205), and this binding is regulated by phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue at codon 401. It would also be Fig. 4. PTEN binding activity to LMVs. A representative silver-stained gel of protein bound to LMVs is shown. P, the pellet fraction coprecipitated with LMVs.

Finally, we found that some mutants with partial phosphatase activity against Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (G20E, M134L, S227F, and K342N) showed nearly wild-type levels of phosphatase activity against PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. It is possible that certain PTEN mutations impair phosphatase activity only toward one type of inositol phosphate molecule [Ins(1,3,4,5)P4] but not others [i.e., PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] and therefore affect distinct cellular signaling pathways because these two molecules have different functions in the cell: Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 is a second messenger involved in regulating intracellular calcium signaling, whereas PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is well known as a second messenger molecule generated by PI3K activity (20). Taken together, PTEN phosphatase activity could be regulated by subcellular location, phosphorylation, and/or interaction with other cellular proteins. The physiological function of PTEN remains to be clarified in additional experiments.\n",

Identification of mutations in these genes is extremely beneficial for patients pursuing risk reduction strategies. Approximately 7% of individuals who have genetic testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 carry a variant of uncertain significance (VUS), making clinical management less certain. The majority of identified VUS occur only in one to two individuals; these variants are not able to be classified using current classification models with segregation analysis components.  Methods  To develop a clinically applicable method that can predict the pathogenicity of VUS that does not require familial information or segregation analysis, we identified characteristics of breast or ovarian tumors that distinguished sporadic tumors from tumors with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Study participants included individuals with known deleterious mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 and individuals with classified or unclassified BRCA variants.  Results  We applied the models to 57 tumors with 43 different deleterious BRCA mutations and 57 tumors with 54 unique classified and unclassified BRCA variants. Of the 33 previously unclassified VUS studied, we found evidence of neutrality for 21.  Conclusion  Our models showed 98% sensitivity and 76% specificity for predicting classified DNA changes. We classified 64% of unknown variants as neutral. Classification of VUS as neutral will have immediate benefit for those individuals and their family members. These models are adaptable for the clinic and will be useful for individuals with limited available family history.  Go to: INTRODUCTION Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 confer a greatly increased lifetime risk for breast and ovarian cancer. The number of individuals who have had genetic testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the United States now exceeds 70,000.1 Individuals who carry a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 can increase the likelihood of detecting cancers at an earlier stage by more stringent surveillance and can decrease their chance of developing cancer through the use of prophylactic surgery and/or chemopreventive agents. Of the high-risk individuals who have had mutation analyses through Myriad Genetic Laboratories (Salt Lake City, UT), approximately 7% have a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in BRCA1 or BRCA2.2-4 VUS are typically missense or potential splice site changes of uncertain biologic or clinical relevance. They are more frequent in the minority ethnic populations.3 More than 1,500 VUS have been identified; most have only been reported in one to two individuals.  Through prediction studies, some BRCA VUS have been classified as neutral polymorphisms, and a small number of BRCA VUS have been classified as likely deleterious. Many of the predicted deleterious VUS are located in highly conserved functional domains or affect transcript start or splice sites. Still, the majority of variants have yet to be classified.4-11 Several of the algorithms used to characterize VUS use familial segregation analysis or study variants in multiple unrelated individuals to provide evidence for or against causality. One difficulty with this approach is that the vast majority of reported VUS have been observed in only one or two individuals, which makes them ineligible for segregation analysis. Also, population-based studies in BRCA carriers have shown that more than 50% of BRCA-positive individuals may not have a close family member with a BRCA-related cancer who would be available for segregation analysis.12 Finally, some individuals with BRCA VUS have BRCA-related cancers segregating on both sides of the family. Thus, it is important to develop additional means to classify VUS that do not rely on segregation and can be applied in various clinical settings.  To address this need, we developed four BRCA VUS classification models that use clinical information typically available from pathology and mutation testing reports combined with protein prediction model data, cancer type, and tumor loss of heterozygosity (LOH) data. We applied these models to 57 tumors with deleterious BRCA mutations and 57 tumors with classified and/or unclassified variants.  Go to: METHODS Human Samples  Studies were approved by local institutional review boards. All study participants signed informed consent for this research. Paired normal and tumor tissues were ascertained through one of the following three sources: The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center Clinical Cancer Genetics Program, the Mayo Clinic Familial Cancer Program, and the University of California, San Francisco Familial Risk Shared Resource. Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of breast or ovarian cancer, available normal and tumor DNA, available pathology records, and a BRCA testing report showing a BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 deleterious mutation, VUS, or a reclassified variant. Hematoxylin and eosin slides from tumors were reviewed by a pathologist, and areas comprising greater then 70% tumor cells were microdissected from sections or were cored. Normal DNA was isolated from blood or histologically normal breast tissue. Lymphoblastoid cell lines were established on a subset of individuals.  Genomic DNA was isolated from fixed archival tissue by removal of paraffin using xylene and ethanol washes. Protein was removed by proteinase K treatment for 48 hours at 55Â°C in nucleic acid lysis buffer. Samples were phenol/chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated.  Allele-Specific LOH  We used restriction fragment length polymorphism studies and sequence analysis to conduct allele-specific LOH analysis. When a mutation or variant altered a restriction enzyme site, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were digested with the appropriate enzyme, separated on an agarose gel, and stained with ethidium bromide. Bands were visualized on an Alphaimager (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). For mutations resulting in deletions of more than 20 base pairs, PCR products were run directly on a 1.5% agarose gel. LOH was assessed visually for restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. When the results were visually ambiguous, ratios of cut to uncut band of normal and tumor DNA were taken using band intensity. Samples were scored as loss if the ratios were greater than 1.5 or less than 0.67 according to criteria used in other studies.13,14 To avoid undercalling LOH, we scored samples as uncertain if ratios fell between 0.67 and 0.76 or 1.35 and 1.50. For changes not resulting in an altered restriction site, PCR products were treated with ExoSap-It (USB, Cleveland, OH) and sequenced. Sequence traces in the forward and reverse direction were compared between control DNA and normal DNA and tumor DNA containing the sequence change using DNAstar 3.0 (DNASTAR, Inc, Madison, WI). Loss was determined visually by two reviewers and consisted of at least 30% difference between the two alleles compared with normal carrier ratios.  Evolutionary Conservation  We used align grantham variation deviation analysis (A-GVGD) to identify missense changes of potential functional significance (http://agvgd.iarc.fr/alignments.php).6,15 A-GVGD uses a combination of the physical properties of amino acids and protein sequence alignments from multiple species to predict if missense substitutions are more likely to be neutral or affect protein function. Because deleterious missense changes have not been reported outside of conserved BRCA domains,4 we applied A-GVGD only to missense changes occurring in the following three conserved domains: BRCA1 ring domain (amino acids 1 to 102), BRCA1 breast cancer C-terminal domain (amino acids 1641 to 1863), or BRCA2 DNA binding domain (amino acids 2401 to 3200). A-GVGD analysis assigns a probability class to each variant studied ranging from class (C) 0 variants, which are expected to be neutral, to C65 variants, which are expected to affect protein function. Using data from 1,400 VUS,4 prior probabilities of a change being deleterious for the A-GVGD classes of variants mapping to conserved regions were as follows: C65 = 0.81; C35, C45, and C55 = 0.66; C15 and C25 = 0.29; and C0 = 0.01.16 From these likelihood probabilities, we calculated odds of being deleterious for the A-GVGD classes falling into conserved domains as follows: C0 = 0.01; C15 and C25 = 0.41; C35, C45, and C55 = 1.5; and C65 = 4.26. All other missense changes were given a probability of being deleterious of 0.01.4  Splicing Studies  To determine whether any VUS affected normal splicing patterns and, therefore, could be functional changes, we used ESEfinder and SpliceSiteFinder to measure the theoretical effect on splicing.17,18 These programs are used to identify exonic splice enhancer motifs (ESEfinder) or putative splice sites (SpliceSiteFinder). We isolated RNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines from individuals carrying putative splice site mutations for use in splicing studies. We performed reverse transcriptase PCR using primer sets from the two flanking exons as well as primer sets between the flanking exon and the potentially aberrantly spliced exon using cDNA from patients and wild-type controls. We noted aberrant splicing in cases where bands of sizes other than those seen in 11 wild-type cDNA controls were present. To confirm abnormal splicing, we sequenced any extra bands.  Observation With a Deleterious Mutation  Because homozygous BRCA1 mutations are expected to be lethal and homozygous BRCA2 mutations are expected to result in lethality or phenotypes such as Fanconi anemia, the presence of a deleterious mutation in trans with a variant suggests its neutrality.6 We used data from mutation reports and the literature to determine whether variants in our study had been observed in trans with a deleterious mutation. For our models, we used the published estimates of the probabilities of two deleterious mutations occurring in trans in BRCA1 and BRCA2 of P = .0001 and P = .001, respectively.5  Model Phenotypes  To identify tumor characteristics that would be useful in discriminating deleterious variants from nondeleterious variants, we searched the literature for studies comparing characteristics of breast and ovarian tumors from BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-positive and mutation-negative individuals. We identified a number of characteristics available in most pathology reports that could be used in a prediction model (Table 1). 5,19-56 When a considerable range of frequency estimates was observed for a characteristic, we calculated an average frequency based on raw numbers from all of the studies. Not surprisingly, the features predictive of mutation status varied between both breast and ovarian cancer and between BRCA1 and BRCA2. As a result, we created likelihood odds for four predictive models, one for each gene and tumor type, that differ only between gene/cancer site and model-specific likelihood odds (Appendix Table A1, online only; see also Appendix, online only).  Table 1. Table 1. Frequency of Histopathologic Characteristics of BRCA1, BRCA2, and Sporadic Tumors Statistical Methods  To derive odds of pathogenicity for each variant, we used a modified multifactorial approach that combines the odds of causation of independent variables.4,5,7,9 Odds for each independent variable were determined from frequencies reported in the literature or published odds, with the exception of truncating mutations and splice site alterations for which we calculated odds of being deleterious of 1,000:1 if splicing defects or truncating mutations were identified and odds of 0.01 if splicing defects were not observed. The product of the likelihoods of independent variables was obtained to provide an overall odds of pathogenicity for each sequence alteration (additional details are in Appendix). On the basis of previous studies, we used a cutoff of 1,000:1 in favor of being deleterious and a cutoff of 100:1 in favor of being neutral for final classification status.4,5 When two independent tumors with the same sequence alteration were identified, independent factors for both were combined and considered in the final data interpretation. We calculated odds both with and without LOH data because LOH data may not be typically available clinically and the frequency of LOH in neutral BRCA variants has not been well documented. If a prediction of variant status was only significant in the combined odds using LOH data, we scored the variant as suspected neutral or suspected deleterious accordingly.  Go to: RESULTS Identification of Study Criteria for the Models  We collected tumor and normal tissue and histopathologic and clinical data from the medical records and mutation reports of 102 individuals with BRCA mutations or characterized or uncharacterized variants (Table 2). The study group consisted of 57 tumors with 43 unique deleterious mutations and 57 tumors with 54 unique variants (Tables 2, ,3,3, and and4;4; Appendix Tables A2 and A3, online only).  Table 2. Table 2. Study Population Table 3. Table 3. Examples of Characteristics for Predictive Breast Models Table 4. Table 4. Examples of Characteristics for Predictive Ovarian Models LOH  One characteristic of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation tumors that has been used previously to assess pathogenicity of BRCA VUS is tumor LOH.5,11,25 LOH occurs more frequently in BRCA mutationâ€“positive tumors than sporadic tumors and is thought to occur predominantly on the nonmutated chromosome (Table 1).5,11,25,26,28 LOH in tumors with a neutral BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant is predicted to be random for loss of variant or wild-type allele; however, LOH in this group has not been well studied. To determine whether our observed rates of LOH were comparable to published rates, we successfully conducted allele-specific LOH studies on 56 of 57 tumors from carriers of known deleterious mutations. We detected LOH of the wild-type BRCA1 allele in 85% of breast tumors (28 of 33 tumors) and 100% of ovarian tumors (three of three tumors; Tables 3 and and4;4; Appendix Tables A2 and A3). We observed LOH of the wild-type BRCA2 allele in 63% of breast tumors (10 of 16 tumors) and 25% of ovarian tumors (one of four tumors). We also observed loss of the mutant allele in one BRCA1 breast tumor and in one BRCA2 breast tumor (Appendix Table A2). The BRCA1 frequencies of LOH are similar to published rates. However, the BRCA2 frequencies of loss were slightly lower than expected and lower than the frequencies used in other studies.5 We were also surprised by the high observed frequency of LOH of the mutant allele in breast tumors (one of 33 tumors for BRCA1 and one of 16 tumors for BRCA2). On the basis of our data and previous published reports, we used a frequency of LOH to generate likelihood ratios of the wild-type allele of 79% and 69% for BRCA1- for BRCA2-positive breast tumors, respectively, and 89% and 79% for BRCA1- and BRCA2-positive ovarian tumors, respectively, in our prediction models (Appendix Table A1). For deleterious mutations, we assumed that 1% of the time there would be loss of the mutant allele, as has been suggested in the literature.5,11,25,26,28  We successfully assessed allele-specific LOH in 55 of 57 tumors with BRCA VUS (Tables 2 and and3;3; Appendix Tables A2 and A3). Twenty-nine percent of tumors (six of 21 tumors) with BRCA1 VUS showed LOH of the wild-type allele, 14% of tumors (three of 21 tumors) showed LOH of the variant allele, and 57% of tumors (12 of 21 tumors) showed no imbalance. For BRCA2, 26% of breast tumors (nine of 34 tumors) showed wild-type allele loss, 23% of tumors (eight of 34 tumors) showed variant allele loss, and 50% of tumors (17 of 34 tumors) showed no imbalance. Variants BRCA1 IVS2-14 C&amp;gt;T, S127N, and V1804D and BRCA2 A1170V, E2856A, H1966Y, I2285V, M784V, N1878K, and Y42C were lost in tumors providing evidence for neutrality.  Sequence-Based Methods to Determine Pathogenicity  On the basis of a study of more than 1,433 BRCA VUS, pathogenic VUS are most likely to occur in regions that are highly conserved across species, occur in specific BRCA protein domains, and/or affect splicing.4 Five BRCA1 and nine BRCA2 missense changes fell in or near highly conserved domains. For these variants, we used A-AVGD, a statistical algorithm validated and widely used for the study of BRCA VUS, to assign classes of C0 (neutral) to C65 (likely deleterious).5,6,9,15,16 A-AVGD classified 10 of these variants as C0 or neutral (Tables 2 and and3;3; Appendix Tables A2 and A3). Three VUS and one suspected mutation were assigned a higher class and given an increased likelihood of being deleterious (Tables 5 and and6;6; Appendix Tables A4 and A5, online only).  Table 5. Table 5. Examples of Breast Tumor Odds Table 6. Table 6. Examples of Ovarian Tumor Odds Splicing Studies  Using ESEfinder and SpliceSiteFinder, none of the missense variants were predicted to affect splicing (Appendix Tables A4 and A5). To study splicing defects of intronic variants, we isolated RNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines for four individuals with unclassified intronic VUS and from one individual with an intronic variant classified as deleterious. cDNA from 11 individuals not carrying the variants and genomic DNA from the carriers were used as controls. None of the four VUS studied (BRCA1 IVS2-14 C&amp;gt;T and IVS20-14 C&amp;gt;G and BRCA2 IVS23+9 C&amp;gt;T and IVS8-12delTA) showed splicing defects in contrast to the intervening sequence variant previously classified as deleterious (BRCA1 IVS5-11 G&amp;gt;T; data not shown).  Prediction of Deleterious Status  To classify BRCA VUS, we developed four weighted models that incorporated allele-specific LOH, tumor histopathology, evolutionary prediction and splicing, and observation with a deleterious mutation (Tables 5 and and6;6; Appendix Tables A4 and A5). Because LOH may not be as readily available as some of the other parameters used in our models and the frequencies of LOH in tumors with neutral BRCA variants have not been well documented, we calculated combined odds with and without LOH status (Tables 5 and and6;6; Appendix Tables A4 and A5). The combined sensitivity of our four models was 98% for known deleterious mutations (42 of 43 deleterious mutations were predicted as deleterious or suspected deleterious), and the specificity was 76% for previously classified neutral changes (16 of 21 neutral VUS were predicted neutral or suspected neutral).4-6,8,9,57-62 The known sequence alterations not classified as deleterious or neutral were all classified as uncertain; none were incorrectly classified. Of previously unclassified variants, 64% (21 of 33 variants) were classified as neutral by our models.  Go to: DISCUSSION We developed four models for the prediction of BRCA VUS that do not require family history information or segregation analysis. To our knowledge, we describe the first models for the characterization of BRCA VUS that use ovarian tumor histopathology to characterize VUS. Using these models, we characterized 21 BRCA VUS as neutral. Of known deleterious mutations, none were incorrectly classified as neutral, and of predicted neutral variants, none were incorrectly classified as deleterious. For known or predicted deleterious mutations, our models showed 98% sensitivity. No VUS in this study were predicted to be deleterious.  In our study, one known deleterious truncating BRCA1 mutation was not classified as deleterious or suspected deleterious. The tumor sample was from a 75-year-old woman. It did not show LOH and had pathologic characteristics (estrogen receptor [ER] positive and progesterone receptor [PR] positive) more typical of a non-BRCA1, sporadic tumor observed in women of this age. It is possible that this tumor is a phenocopy and not a result of the patient&amp;#39;s inherited BRCA1 mutation.  A few VUS, such as BRCA2 IVS13+5 G&amp;gt;C and BRCA1 L1764P, showed odds of greater than 20:1 in favor of being deleterious and warrant additional studies for characterization. L1764P has shown suggestive odds for being deleterious in other studies.4,58 A number of VUS were close to a cutoff of 100:1 in favor of a neutral classification. These are likely to be neutral; however, further studies are needed to clarify their status.  These models can be readily adapted for use in the clinical setting or for an online clinical prediction tool because all of the weighting factors, except for LOH, are available from mutation and pathology reports, online programs, and published resources. Thus, these models offer a significant advantage over other models currently used to predict VUS status. Recently, a study by the kConFab group proposed a similar model using tumor histopathology as one feature to classify BRCA VUS.63 The main differences between our models and the kConFab model are that the kConFab model included segregation analysis, a different protein prediction method, and immunohistochemical staining of basal cytokeratins. Their model also did not evaluate VUS found in ovarian tumors. One advantage of our model over other models is that it does not require segregation analysis or additional laboratory analysis. For example, basal cytokeratin staining is not yet commonly used in many pathology laboratories for breast cancer diagnosis purposes. However, ER, PR, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 staining are part of routine practice for breast cancer pathology. In addition, a recent article suggests that, although basal cytokeratins can help to predict BRCA1 mutationâ€“positive tumors, cytokeratin staining itself was not as good a predictor as age of onset and ER, PR, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status.42 Seventy-two percent of the 20 VUS in the kConFab study, including some previously characterized variants, and 64% of the 33 unclassified VUS in our study were classified. Together, these studies demonstrate that inclusion of histopathology can be powerful for the characterization of BRCA VUS.  Individuals and their at-risk family members who carry a BRCA VUS often delay making decisions about their cancer risk management or make management decisions based on uncertain information. These individuals are also not able to take full advantage of prevention and therapeutic strategies typically offered to deleterious mutation carriers. Classification of 21 previously unclassified VUS using the models described here has the potential to help the individuals who carry these variants. Our models should also be useful for the classification of additional BRCA VUS in individuals from whom limited family history is available.&quot;&gt;\n",
       "                Twenty percent of individuals with a strong family and/or personal history of breast and ovarian cancer carry a deleterious mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Identification of mutations in these genes is extremely beneficial for patients pursuing risk reduction strategies. Approximately 7% of individuals who have genetic testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 carry a variant of uncertain significance (VUS), making clinical management less certain. The majority of identified VUS occur only in one to two individuals; these variants are not able to be classified using current classification models with segregation analysis components.  Methods  To develop a clinically applicable method that can predict the pathogenicity of VUS that does not require familial information or segregation analysis, we identified characteristics of breast or ovarian tumors that distinguished sporadic tumors from tumors with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Study participants included individuals with known deleterious mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 and individuals with classified or unclassified BRCA variants.  Results  We applied the models to 57 tumors with 43 different deleterious BRCA mutations and 57 tumors with 54 unique classified and unclassified BRCA variants. Of the 33 previously unclassified VUS studied, we found evidence of neutrality for 21.  Conclusion  Our models showed 98% sensitivity and 76% specificity for predicting classified DNA changes. We classified 64% of unknown variants as neutral. Classification of VUS as neutral will have immediate benefit for those individuals and their family members. These models are adaptable for the clinic and will be useful for individuals with limited available family history.

A-GVGD analysis assigns a probability class to each variant studied ranging from class (C) 0 variants, which are expected to be neutral, to C65 variants, which are expected to affect protein function. Using data from 1,400 VUS,4 prior probabilities of a change being deleterious for the A-GVGD classes of variants mapping to conserved regions were as follows: C65 = 0.81; C35, C45, and C55 = 0.66; C15 and C25 = 0.29; and C0 = 0.01.16 From these likelihood probabilities, we calculated odds of being deleterious for the A-GVGD classes falling into conserved domains as follows: C0 = 0.01; C15 and C25 = 0.41; C35, C45, and C55 = 1.5; and C65 = 4.26. All other missense changes were given a probability of being deleterious of 0.01.4  Splicing Studies  To determine whether any VUS affected normal splicing patterns and, therefore, could be functional changes, we used ESEfinder and SpliceSiteFinder to measure the theoretical effect on splicing.17,18 These programs are used to identify exonic splice enhancer motifs (ESEfinder) or putative splice sites (SpliceSiteFinder).

As a result, we created likelihood odds for four predictive models, one for each gene and tumor type, that differ only between gene/cancer site and model-specific likelihood odds (Appendix Table A1, online only; see also Appendix, online only).  Table 1. Table 1.

We calculated odds both with and without LOH data because LOH data may not be typically available clinically and the frequency of LOH in neutral BRCA variants has not been well documented. If a prediction of variant status was only significant in the combined odds using LOH data, we scored the variant as suspected neutral or suspected deleterious accordingly.  Go to: RESULTS Identification of Study Criteria for the Models  We collected tumor and normal tissue and histopathologic and clinical data from the medical records and mutation reports of 102 individuals with BRCA mutations or characterized or uncharacterized variants (Table 2). The study group consisted of 57 tumors with 43 unique deleterious mutations and 57 tumors with 54 unique variants (Tables 2, ,3,3, and and4;4; Appendix Tables A2 and A3, online only).  Table 2. Table 2. Study Population Table 3. Table 3. Examples of Characteristics for Predictive Breast Models Table 4. Table 4.

To determine whether our observed rates of LOH were comparable to published rates, we successfully conducted allele-specific LOH studies on 56 of 57 tumors from carriers of known deleterious mutations. We detected LOH of the wild-type BRCA1 allele in 85% of breast tumors (28 of 33 tumors) and 100% of ovarian tumors (three of three tumors; Tables 3 and and4;4; Appendix Tables A2 and A3). We observed LOH of the wild-type BRCA2 allele in 63% of breast tumors (10 of 16 tumors) and 25% of ovarian tumors (one of four tumors). We also observed loss of the mutant allele in one BRCA1 breast tumor and in one BRCA2 breast tumor (Appendix Table A2). The BRCA1 frequencies of LOH are similar to published rates. However, the BRCA2 frequencies of loss were slightly lower than expected and lower than the frequencies used in other studies.5 We were also surprised by the high observed frequency of LOH of the mutant allele in breast tumors (one of 33 tumors for BRCA1 and one of 16 tumors for BRCA2). On the basis of our data and previous published reports, we used a frequency of LOH to generate likelihood ratios of the wild-type allele of 79% and 69% for BRCA1- for BRCA2-positive breast tumors, respectively, and 89% and 79% for BRCA1- and BRCA2-positive ovarian tumors, respectively, in our prediction models (Appendix Table A1). For deleterious mutations, we assumed that 1% of the time there would be loss of the mutant allele, as has been suggested in the literature.5,11,25,26,28  We successfully assessed allele-specific LOH in 55 of 57 tumors with BRCA VUS (Tables 2 and and3;3; Appendix Tables A2 and A3). Twenty-nine percent of tumors (six of 21 tumors) with BRCA1 VUS showed LOH of the wild-type allele, 14% of tumors (three of 21 tumors) showed LOH of the variant allele, and 57% of tumors (12 of 21 tumors) showed no imbalance. For BRCA2, 26% of breast tumors (nine of 34 tumors) showed wild-type allele loss, 23% of tumors (eight of 34 tumors) showed variant allele loss, and 50% of tumors (17 of 34 tumors) showed no imbalance. Variants BRCA1 IVS2-14 C&amp;gt;T, S127N, and V1804D and BRCA2 A1170V, E2856A, H1966Y, I2285V, M784V, N1878K, and Y42C were lost in tumors providing evidence for neutrality.  Sequence-Based Methods to Determine Pathogenicity  On the basis of a study of more than 1,433 BRCA VUS, pathogenic VUS are most likely to occur in regions that are highly conserved across species, occur in specific BRCA protein domains, and/or affect splicing.4 Five BRCA1 and nine BRCA2 missense changes fell in or near highly conserved domains. For these variants, we used A-AVGD, a statistical algorithm validated and widely used for the study of BRCA VUS, to assign classes of C0 (neutral) to C65 (likely deleterious).5,6,9,15,16 A-AVGD classified 10 of these variants as C0 or neutral (Tables 2 and and3;3; Appendix Tables A2 and A3). Three VUS and one suspected mutation were assigned a higher class and given an increased likelihood of being deleterious (Tables 5 and and6;6; Appendix Tables A4 and A5, online only).  Table 5. Table 5. Examples of Breast Tumor Odds Table 6. Table 6. Examples of Ovarian Tumor Odds Splicing Studies  Using ESEfinder and SpliceSiteFinder, none of the missense variants were predicted to affect splicing (Appendix Tables A4 and A5). To study splicing defects of intronic variants, we isolated RNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines for four individuals with unclassified intronic VUS and from one individual with an intronic variant classified as deleterious. cDNA from 11 individuals not carrying the variants and genomic DNA from the carriers were used as controls. None of the four VUS studied (BRCA1 IVS2-14 C&amp;gt;T and IVS20-14 C&amp;gt;G and BRCA2 IVS23+9 C&amp;gt;T and IVS8-12delTA) showed splicing defects in contrast to the intervening sequence variant previously classified as deleterious (BRCA1 IVS5-11 G&amp;gt;T; data not shown).  Prediction of Deleterious Status  To classify BRCA VUS, we developed four weighted models that incorporated allele-specific LOH, tumor histopathology, evolutionary prediction and splicing, and observation with a deleterious mutation (Tables 5 and and6;6; Appendix Tables A4 and A5). Because LOH may not be as readily available as some of the other parameters used in our models and the frequencies of LOH in tumors with neutral BRCA variants have not been well documented, we calculated combined odds with and without LOH status (Tables 5 and and6;6; Appendix Tables A4 and A5). The combined sensitivity of our four models was 98% for known deleterious mutations (42 of 43 deleterious mutations were predicted as deleterious or suspected deleterious), and the specificity was 76% for previously classified neutral changes (16 of 21 neutral VUS were predicted neutral or suspected neutral).4-6,8,9,57-62 The known sequence alterations not classified as deleterious or neutral were all classified as uncertain; none were incorrectly classified. Of previously unclassified variants, 64% (21 of 33 variants) were classified as neutral by our models.  Go to: DISCUSSION We developed four models for the prediction of BRCA VUS that do not require family history information or segregation analysis. To our knowledge, we describe the first models for the characterization of BRCA VUS that use ovarian tumor histopathology to characterize VUS. Using these models, we characterized 21 BRCA VUS as neutral. Of known deleterious mutations, none were incorrectly classified as neutral, and of predicted neutral variants, none were incorrectly classified as deleterious. For known or predicted deleterious mutations, our models showed 98% sensitivity. No VUS in this study were predicted to be deleterious.  In our study, one known deleterious truncating BRCA1 mutation was not classified as deleterious or suspected deleterious. The tumor sample was from a 75-year-old woman. It did not show LOH and had pathologic characteristics (estrogen receptor [ER] positive and progesterone receptor [PR] positive) more typical of a non-BRCA1, sporadic tumor observed in women of this age. It is possible that this tumor is a phenocopy and not a result of the patient&amp;#39;s inherited BRCA1 mutation.  A few VUS, such as BRCA2 IVS13+5 G&amp;gt;C and BRCA1 L1764P, showed odds of greater than 20:1 in favor of being deleterious and warrant additional studies for characterization. L1764P has shown suggestive odds for being deleterious in other studies.4,58 A number of VUS were close to a cutoff of 100:1 in favor of a neutral classification. These are likely to be neutral; however, further studies are needed to clarify their status.  These models can be readily adapted for use in the clinical setting or for an online clinical prediction tool because all of the weighting factors, except for LOH, are available from mutation and pathology reports, online programs, and published resources. Thus, these models offer a significant advantage over other models currently used to predict VUS status. Recently, a study by the kConFab group proposed a similar model using tumor histopathology as one feature to classify BRCA VUS.63 The main differences between our models and the kConFab model are that the kConFab model included segregation analysis, a different protein prediction method, and immunohistochemical staining of basal cytokeratins. Their model also did not evaluate VUS found in ovarian tumors. One advantage of our model over other models is that it does not require segregation analysis or additional laboratory analysis. For example, basal cytokeratin staining is not yet commonly used in many pathology laboratories for breast cancer diagnosis purposes. However, ER, PR, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 staining are part of routine practice for breast cancer pathology. In addition, a recent article suggests that, although basal cytokeratins can help to predict BRCA1 mutationâ€“positive tumors, cytokeratin staining itself was not as good a predictor as age of onset and ER, PR, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status.42 Seventy-two percent of the 20 VUS in the kConFab study, including some previously characterized variants, and 64% of the 33 unclassified VUS in our study were classified. Together, these studies demonstrate that inclusion of histopathology can be powerful for the characterization of BRCA VUS.  Individuals and their at-risk family members who carry a BRCA VUS often delay making decisions about their cancer risk management or make management decisions based on uncertain information. These individuals are also not able to take full advantage of prevention and therapeutic strategies typically offered to deleterious mutation carriers. Classification of 21 previously unclassified VUS using the models described here has the potential to help the individuals who carry these variants. Our models should also be useful for the classification of additional BRCA VUS in individuals from whom limited family history is available.\n",

       "            &lt;td class=&quot;fillremaining&quot; title=&quot;Genes encoding components of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling axis are frequently mutated in cancer, but few mutations have been characterized in MTOR, the gene for the mTOR kinase. Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data, we generated a comprehensive catalog of mTOR pathway mutations in cancer, identifying 33 MTOR mutations that confer pathway hyperactivation. The mutations cluster in six distinct regions in the C-terminal half of mTOR and occur in multiple cancer types, with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney cancer. The activating mutations do not affect mTOR complex assembly, but a subset reduces binding to the mTOR inhibitor Deptor. mTORC1 signaling in cells expressing various activating mutations remains sensitive to pharmacological mTOR inhibition, but is partially resistant to nutrient deprivation. Lastly, cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations display heightened sensitivity to rapamycin both in culture and as in vivo xenografts, suggesting that such mutations confer mTOR pathway dependency.  Keywords: personalized, mTOR, mutations, biomarker, deptor Go to: Introduction In mammals, the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway regulates cell size, mRNA translation, autophagy and many metabolic processes, including lipid synthesis (1). A variety of upstream regulators control the activity of the serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR and many of these are deregulated in cancer, resulting in pathway hyperactivation. Such activation occurs most commonly through loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressors, such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), tuberous sclerosis 1/2 (TSC1/2), neurofibromin 1/2 (NF1/2), or oncogenic mutations in KRAS, PIK3CA, or AKT (2). However, few cancer-associated mutations have been functionally characterized in MTOR itself, with only two reports thus far describing such mutations. In the first report, the authors tested six cancer-associated MTOR mutations and observed that two (S2215Y from a colorectal sample and R2505P from a kidney sample) conferred mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activation (3). In the second report, the authors identified an mTORC1 activating MTOR mutation (L2431P) that was present in a portion but not the entirety of a primary kidney tumor (4). Although these initial reports establish that activating MTOR mutations do arise in cancer, they were based upon limited sample sets that do not reflect the diverse subtypes of cancer. More recently, cancer genome sequencing projects, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), have identified a vast number of somatic mutations in thousands of tumors from more than 40 cancer subtypes (5-7).  Using publicly available databases of cancer genome sequence data, we cataloged all mutations in mTOR pathway components. We annotated over 400 samples with missense mutations in the MTOR gene from dozens of cancer subtypes, most of which lie within six clusters in the part of the gene that encodes the C-terminal portion of mTOR. Furthermore, through functional analyses, we identify 33 novel mTOR pathway-activating mutations, some of which affect the capacity of mTOR to interact with its partner proteins. None of the activating mutations impact the sensitivity of mTORC1 activity in cells to mTOR inhibitors but a subset confer mTORC1 signaling resistance to nutrient deprivation. Importantly, cancer cells that naturally express a subset of the mutations are hypersensitive to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. These findings may have translational relevance as rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) are clinically approved for the treatment of cancer, and several ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitors are in development (8). As tumor biopsies are increasingly subjected to whole exome sequencing, the hyperactivating MTOR mutations we characterize may serve as biomarkers in predicting cancer response to mTOR-targeting drugs.  Go to: Results Catalog of recurring mutations in genes encoding mTOR pathway components  To generate a comprehensive catalog of all cancer-associated missense mutations in canonical genes of the mTOR pathway, we analyzed partial genome sequencing data from the TCGA, CCLE, International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) databases (5-7, 9, 10). This analysis revealed that almost every gene in the mTOR pathway harbored somatic point mutations (Supplementary Table 1). To enrich for mutations that are more likely to affect pathway function, only mutations that alter the same codon more than once were counted. When normalized for gene length, this analysis revealed that MTOR contained the highest percentage of recurring mutations, and thus we focused most of our attention on these mutations (Supplementary Figure 1). Collectively, through data mining and a literature search, we curated over 400 samples with non-synonymous MTOR point mutations (Figure 1B and Supplementary Table 2) (11-17). While the majority of these mutations are represented by only one sample in our database, approximately 40% are recurrent, most of which have not been previously described. Additionally, the mutations cluster in six distinct regions of mTOR centered on highly recurrent mutations that alter amino acids C1483, E1799, T1977, S2215, L2427 and R2505 (Figure 1C). The presence of these clusters suggests that there is a selective advantage to acquiring mutations in certain regions of the mTOR protein. Furthermore, these mutations are present in multiple cancer subtypes, with the highest number in colorectal, endometrial, and lung cancers, although these cancer subtypes are also considered to have the highest mutation rates (Figures 1D and 1E) (18). Interestingly, a random mutagenesis screen in the S. pombe mTOR homolog (tor2) identified activating mutations in homologous amino acid positions to many of those we find in MTOR to be recurrently mutated in cancer (19) (Supplementary Table 3).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Cancer-associated MTOR mutations mTORC1/2 activating mutations in MTOR  The prevalence of the recurrent mutations, their clustering, and correlation with activating tor2 mutations strongly suggested that the MTOR mutations impact mTOR pathway activity. To test this possibility, wild-type (WT) or ten different mutants of mTOR (L1460P, C1483F, E1799K, F1888L, T1977R, V2006I, S2215Y, I2500F, R2505P, and D2512H) were expressed in cells and phosphorylation of the mTORC1/2 substrates S6K1, 4EBP1, or Akt1 examined (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C). All the mTOR mutants conferred varying degrees of pathway activation, and, interestingly, a few displayed some substrate preference (L1460P, C1483F, S2215Y, and R2505P towards S6K1/4EBP1 or V2006I towards Akt1), implying that these mutations have greater effects on mTORC1 or mTORC2. Thus, while three pathway activating MTOR mutations have previously been identified (3, 4), our initial analyses uncovered an additional eight recurrent MTOR mutations which activate mTORC1 and/or mTORC2.  Figure 2 Figure 2 mTORC1 and mTORC2 activating mutations in MTOR and RHEB It is well established that two activating mutations (E545K and H1047R) within the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PI3K-p110Î±), encoded by the PIK3CA gene, can lead to mTOR pathway activation (20). To determine the degree of mTOR pathway activation conferred by mTOR mutation, S6K1 phosphorylation from cells expressing WT or S2215Y mTOR was compared to cells expressing WT or mutant PI3K-p110Î± (Supplementary Figures 2A and 2B). This revealed that while expression of only mutant mTOR conferred mTORC1 activation, expression of either WT or mutant PI3K-p110Î± induced mTORC1 activity.  Non-recurrent MTOR mutations that activate mTORC1 signaling  We next examined in more detail the nature of the activating MTOR mutations, and observed that while some codons are mutated to only one other residue (e.g. E1799K), others are mutated to several different amino acids (e.g. S2215F/P/T/Y). This is reminiscent of the diverse amino acids to which the G12 residue of KRAS is mutated in cancers (21). We expressed 20 such MTOR mutations and found that many (C1483R/W/Y, F1888I, T1977K, S2215F/P, I2500M), but not all (A41P/S/T, F1888V, T1977S, V2006L, S2215T, R2505Q/*, D2512G/Y), led to increased S6K1 phosphorylation (Supplementary Figures 3 and 5, and data not shown). Given that most of these activating mutations are found only once in our dataset implies that other non-recurrent mutations may also activate mTORC1 signaling. To identify other such mutations, we turned our attention to the mutational clusters identified in Figure 1, and observed that while most are represented by several tissue types, those in the C1483 cluster are particularly prevalent in kidney cancer (Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure 3D). Interestingly, two recent cancer genome sequencing efforts reported that kidney cancers have an increased percentage of mutations in mTOR pathway genes, but the functional consequences of these mutations were not evaluated (13, 22). Expression of the ten kidney cancer-associated MTOR mutations from the C1483 cluster revealed that in addition to the previously evaluated L1460P and C1483F/Y mutants (Figure 1B and Supplemental Figure 2), three non-recurrent mutants (L1433S, A1459P, and E1519T) also induced mTORC1 pathway activity (Figure 2D). Similarly, expression of eight non-recurrent mutations from the S2215 cluster (N2206S, L2209V, A2210P, L2216P, R2217W, L2220F, Q2223K, and A2226S) activated mTORC1 signaling as measured by S6K1 phosphorylation, with the L2209V mutant conferring higher activation than even S2215Y (Supplementary Figure 3E). Lastly, other than the S2215Y and R2505P mutations, the only other cancer-associated MTOR mutation previously characterized is L2431P from a kidney cancer patient (4). Expression of mTOR containing this non-recurrent mutation caused mTORC1 activation that was much weaker than that caused by expression of the S2215Y mutant (Supplementary Figure 3F). Collectively, these results suggest that while most non-recurrent MTOR mutations found in cancer are part of the mutational â€œnoiseâ€�, there exists a diverse set of MTOR mutations that can drive mTORC1 pathway activity. Likely, as more cancer genomes are sequenced, the activating non-recurrent mutations we identified will prove to be recurrent.  Recurrent mutations in RHEB activate mTORC1  We also observed that other mTOR pathway genes such as Raptor, Rictor, and Rheb1 harbored recurrent mutations (Supplemental Table 1). Expression of Rheb1 Y35N/C/H and to a lesser degree E139K increased phosphorylation of endogenous S6K1 more than that of WT Rheb1 (Figure 2E), while recurrent mutations in Raptor (R788C) or Rictor (S1101L) failed to induce any mTORC1 or mTORC2 activity (data not shown). In support of the relevance of these mutations to cancer, RHEB was recently highlighted as a novel cancer gene due to the presence of the Y35N mutation (23). Thus, cancer associated mutations in either MTOR or RHEB can induce mTORC1 activity; whether this is true of other mTOR pathway genes remains to be determined.  mTORC1/2 hyperactivating mutants bind less Deptor  One potential mechanism through which the mutations in mTOR (Figure 2) might increase S6K1/Akt1 phosphorylation is by altering mTORC1 or mTORC2 assembly. Alternatively or in addition, the mTOR mutations may diminish the binding of mTOR to its endogenous inhibitor Deptor, which binds to the FAT domain of mTOR (24). To test these possibilities, the interactions of exogenously expressed WT or mutant mTORs with endogenous Raptor, Rictor, and Deptor were measured. All mutant mTOR proteins bound equally well to Raptor and Rictor, suggesting that the mutations do not affect formation of either mTOR complex (Figure 3A). In contrast, Deptor binding to the immunoprecipitated mTOR proteins was reduced in cells expressing the mTOR mutants as compared to WT mTOR (Figure 3A). Given that increased mTOR pathway activity correlates with a reduction in the mTOR-Deptor interaction (24), it is likely that the observed decrease in Deptor binding reflects the increased mTOR pathway activity caused by the MTOR mutations. However, two mTORC1 activating mutations that are in the FAT domain of mTOR, L1460P and C1483Y, bound much less Deptor than the other mutants tested (Figure 3A), suggesting that these mutations directly perturb the Deptor binding site on mTOR. Consistent with this, examination of the mutations from the C1483 cluster described in figure 2D revealed that two other highly activating mutations in the FAT domain (A1459P and C1483Y) also strongly reduced the mTOR-Deptor interaction (Supplementary Figure 4A). While these results suggest a possible mechanism of action for a subset of activating mTOR mutations, they do not preclude other mechanism by which MTOR mutations may impact mTORC1 signaling, such as by increasing the activity of the mTOR kinase domain.  Figure 3 Figure 3 mTOR mutants bind less Deptor and cells expressing the mTOR S2215Y mutation are resistant to nutrient deprivation MTOR mutations do not affect mTORC1 sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors but can affect the pathway response to nutrient deprivation  We next considered the possibility that the mTORC1-activating MTOR mutants have altered sensitivity to established mTOR inhibitors. Engineered mutations in the FRB domain of mTOR, which binds the FKBP12-rapamycin complex, confer marked rapamycin resistance to mTOR (25). To test whether mTOR mutation alters pathway inhibition by rapamycin or Torin1 (an investigational ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor), we used HEK-293 cells with an integrated FLP recombination site (TREX cells) to stably express WT or several different mutants of mTOR (A1459P, C1483Y, E1799K, F1888I, L2209V, S2215Y, L2431P, I2500F, and R2505P), as the mTOR cDNA is too large to be packaged and expressed via a lentiviral delivery system (Supplementary Figure 4B). Baseline phosphorylation of endogenous S6K1 was higher in TREX cells expressing the A1459P, L2209V, S2215Y, I2500F and R2505P mTOR mutants than in parental or WT-expressing cells (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figures 4C and 4D), consistent with the results obtained upon transient expression of these mutants (Figures 2A and 2D, and Supplementary Figure 3D). Importantly, mTORC1 activity in none of the TREX cells was resistant to rapamycin, Torin1, MLN0128 (an mTOR ATP-competitive inhibitor), GDC0980 (a dual PI3K/mTOR ATP-competitive inhibitor), (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figures 4C and 4D). Thus, on a molecular level, while cells with mTOR mutations may display high levels of mTORC1/2 activity, this activity is still sensitive to pharmacological mTOR inhibition.  The kinase activity of mTOR is tightly regulated by nutrient availability; when cells are starved of nutrients (specifically glucose and amino acids), they downregulate mTORC1 signaling, while retreatment of cells with these nutrients restores mTORC1-mediated signaling (26). Given this, we sought to determine whether any of the activating mTOR mutants affect the sensitivity of mTORC1 signaling to amino acid or glucose withdrawal. Indeed, S6K1 phosphorylation was highly resistant to deprivation of either nutrient in cells expressing several mutants (A1459P, S2215Y, I2500F and R2505P) (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figures 4E and 4F). This observation may be relevant in the context of developing tumors, which are often glucose starved (27, 28), where inappropriate mTORC1 activity may provide a growth advantage.  Cancer cells with hyperactivating MTOR mutations are hypersensitive to rapamycin in vitro and in vivo  To determine if cancer cells with MTOR mutations are dependent on mTORC1 activity, we evaluated the impact of rapamycin on the proliferation of set of cancer cell lines harboring WT or mutant mTOR (Figure 4A). We identified four cell lines with mTORC1-activating MTOR mutations (C1483Y in MOLT16; E1799K in HEC59 and SNU349; and S2215Y in JHUEM7) and two with MTOR mutations that have no apparent impact on mTORC1 signaling (V2006L in TUHR10TKB; and R2152C in A375) (Supplementary Figures 5A and 5B). HeLa cells were used as a negative control cell line, as they are mildly rapamycin sensitive and are wild-type for mTOR (7, 29). MCF7 and SW780 cells, which are also wild-type for mTOR, served as positive controls for rapamycin sensitivity because the MCF7 cells harbor an activating PI3K-p110Î± mutation (E545K) while the SW780 cells lack NPRL2, which encodes a component of the GATOR1 negative regulator of the amino acid-sensing pathway (30, 31). Importantly, only the cell lines with activating MTOR mutations, the PI3K-p110Î± mutant, or the NPRL2-null SW780 cells were hypersensitive to rapamycin treatment (Figure 4B). Consistent with these and published results, the growth of HeLa xenografts was partially rapamycin sensitive, while rapamycin completely halted the growth of HEC59 xenografts, which carry the hyperactivating mTOR E1799K mutation (Figure 4C) (32, 33). These results suggest that the presence of hyperactivating MTOR mutations in cancer cells may serve as biomarkers to identify tumors that are likely to respond to mTOR inhibitors.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Rapamycin inhibits the proliferation of cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations Go to: Discussion Early cancer genome sequencing projects led to the identification of three mutations in MTOR that were shown to activate mTORC1 signaling (3, 4). Here, we have identified an additional 33 previously unknown activating MTOR mutations (some are recurrent, others are not) (Supplementary Table 4). Mechanistically, we find that the activating mutations diminish the mTOR-Deptor interaction and interestingly, when mapped onto the recently solved crystal structure of mTOR, the mutations cluster in several distinct locations within the protein itself, suggesting that other activating mechanisms may exist (Supplementary Figure 6) (34). While the mutations do not prevent pharmacological mTOR inhibition, a subset protect against the effects of nutrient deprivation on mTORC1 signaling. Lastly, we demonstrate that cell lines with activating MTOR mutations are particularly sensitive to rapamycin in cell culture and in xenografts, likely due to mTOR pathway dependency.  The diversity of activating MTOR mutations we characterized is reminiscent of the various activating mutations in the prototypical lipid kinase PIK3CA, which encodes for the PI3K catalytic subunit p110Î± (35). However, unlike the activating PIK3CA mutations, which confer equal activation of PI3K-mediated signaling pathways, the diverse MTOR mutations can differentially activate mTORC1 or mTORC2, leading to either S6K1/4EBP1 or Akt1 phosphorylation, respectively. This finding is particularly relevant in a clinical setting, as patients with mTORC1 activating mutations may respond well to FDA-approved rapalogs, while patients with mTORC2 activating mutations might best be treated with ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors, although such inhibitors are still in clinical trials. This distinction is especially relevant for patients with mTORC2 activating mutations, because rapalogs can in some cases upregulate mTORC2 signaling through modulation of an mTORC1-dependent feedback loop (36).  Rapalog-based therapies are currently approved or in clinical trials for several cancer subtypes, and some patients have had dramatic and durable responses to these therapies (37). Given that some cells with activating MTOR mutations are particularly rapamycin sensitive (Figure 4), it is possible that some of the rapalog-responsive patients had tumors with similar mutations. Indeed, it was recently found that the tumor of a bladder cancer patient with two activating MTOR mutations displayed exquisite sensitivity to rapalog-based therapy (38). Many more cancer-associated MTOR mutations will likely be identified in future studies, but functional evaluation of these mutations will be required to determine their impact on the mTOR pathway. As tumor sequencing becomes more commonplace, functional studies such as ours may aid in arriving at a more personalized treatment regimen that eventually promotes patient survival.  Go to: Methods Data acquisition and cluster analysis  All mutations in genes of the mTOR pathway were acquired from the cBIO, COSMIC, and ICGC databases or through a literature search with a data-freeze date of September 1, 2013. To identify regions of mTOR significantly enriched for somatic point mutations, we determined the probability of seeing at least the observed number of mutations in a 50 amino acid sliding window with the null hypothesis being all 463 MTOR mutations randomly occurring across the 2549 amino acid protein. Specifically, we calculated a threshold for significance of at least 15 mutations per 50 amino acids by the formula:  p=âˆ‘n=k463(463k)âˆ—(1âˆ’502549)463âˆ’kâˆ—(502549)k which equals 0.043 for k = at least 15 mutations per 50 amino acids.  Materials  Reagents were obtained from the following sources: antibodies to HA (clone C29F4), S6K1 (clone 49D7), phospho-T389-S6K1 (clone 108D2), and phospho-S473-Akt1 (clone D9E) from Cell Signaling Technology; antibody to GAPDH (clone GT239) from Genetex; antibodies to Deptor and Raptor, X-ray film, and PVDF membrane were from Millipore; antibody to Rictor from Bethyl; antibody to the Flag epitope (clone M2), Flag M2-coupled agarose beads, glucose and amino acid mixtures from Sigma; horseradish-peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; FuGENE HD and Cell Titer Glo from Promega; X-tremeGENE 9 and Complete Protease Mixture from Roche Applied Science; QuikChange II XL from Stratagene; enhanced chemiluminescence reagent and glutathione-coupled agarose beads from Thermo; 8-week-old nude mice from Taconic; rapamycin from LC Labs; MLN0128 and GDC0980 from Selleckchem; and Torin1 was synthesized in the Gray laboratory (39). cDNAs for mTOR and PI3K-p110Î± were from Addgene; expression vectors for HAGST-S6K1, HA-GST-Akt1, and HA-GST-Rheb1 were described previously (24, 40, 41) and Flag-14-3-3Î± was a generous gift from the Yaffe lab. The primers used to generate the mTOR and Rheb1 mutations were from Integrated DNA Technologies and are listed in supplemental table 5. HEK-293T-TREX cell system, 4-12% bis-tris SDS-PAGE gels, and 20x MOPS buffers were from Invitrogen.  Tissue culture and cell lines  MCF7, HELA, HEK-293T, HCT116, A375 and SW780 cells were from ATCC; JHUEM7, MOLT16, NCIH446, SNU349, and TUHR10TKB cells were from the Broad Institute Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia; HEK-293E cells were a generous gift of the Blenis lab; and the HEC59 cells were a generous gift of the Lippard lab. The cell lines have not been re-authenticated, although those from ATCC and the Broad were used within 6 months of resuscitation. The HEK-293T, HEK-293E, HCT116, A375, HEC59, and TUHR10TKB cells were cultured in DMEM; JHUEM7 and MOLT16 cells were cultured in RPMI; and the SW780 cells were cultured in IMDM. All media was prepared with 10% heat inactivated FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. All cell lines were maintained at 37Â°C, 5% CO2.  Site-directed mutagenesis, cloning, and TREX cell line generation  All MTOR and RHEB point mutations were generated in the parental vectors using site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange II XL kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 5. Point mutations were verified using Sanger sequencing as conducted by Eton Biosciences. The HA-GST-4EBP1 reporter vector was generated by synthesizing a gBlock from IDT encoding for 4EBP1 and cloning it into the pRK5-HA-GST vector using SalI and NotI restriction digestion followed by ligation. WT and mutant mTOR cDNAs were subcloned directly from the pcDNA3 vector into the pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector using single site NotI restriction digestion followed by ligation. Flag-mTOR-expressing TREX cells were generated according to the manufacturer&amp;#39;s protocol.  Cell treatments, lysis, and immunoprecipitations  For S6K1 and Akt1 co-transfection assays, 3Ã—105 HEK-293T or HEK-293E cells per well were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates, transfected 24 hours later with 2 Î¼g of mTOR-encoding plasmid and 1 ng of S6K1- or Akt1-encoding plasmid using X-tremeGENE 9 or FuGENE HD, followed by whole cell lysis 48 hours after transfection in NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 substitute, 1 mM EDTA at pH8.0, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM Na-pyrophosphate, 15 mM Na3VO4, 100 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor per 50 mL of buffer). 200-400 Î¼g of whole cell lysates were mixed with 5x SDS-sample buffer to a final concentration of 1-2 Î¼g/Î¼L, boiled for 5 minutes, and then used directly for immunoblotting or frozen at âˆ’20Â°C. For glutathione pull down assays, 2Ã—106 HEK-293T cells were seeded onto 10 cm tissue culture plates, transfected 24 hours later with 10 Î¼g of mTOR-encoding plasmid and 2 ng of S6K1-encoding plasmid using X-tremeGENE 9, and lysed 48-72 hours after transfection in NP-40 lysis buffer. 2-3 mg of the resultant whole-cell lysates were incubated with 30 Î¼L of pre-washed glutathione-coupled agarose beads in a 1 mL volume, which were rotated at 4Â°C for two hours, spun at 2,500 RCF for one minute, washed in 500 Î¼L lysis buffer three times, and the beads directly boiled in 50 Î¼L of 2x SDS-sample buffer. For mTOR immunoprecipitations, the cells were treated as with the glutathione pulldown, except they were lysed/washed in CHAPS buffer (50 mM HEPES at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.4% CHAPS, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM Na-pyrophosphate, 100 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor per 50 mL of buffer) and incubated with Flag-M2-coupled agarose beads.  Immunoblotting  10-50 Î¼g of whole cell lysates, 10-30 Î¼L of glutathione pulldown samples, or 10-30 Î¼L of Flag-M2 immunoprecipitates were loaded into lanes of 4-12% bis-tris SDS-PAGE gels, run at 120 volts for 2 hours in 1x MOPS buffer, and then transferred to 0.45 Î¼m PVDF membrane at 60 volts for 2 hours in 1x transfer buffer (100 mM CAPS, 123 mM NaOH, 10% Ethanol). The membranes were then immunoblotted for the indicated proteins. All primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in 5% BSA W/V TBST, with the exception of GAPDH and Flag antibodies which were diluted 1:2000. All secondary antibodies were diluted 1:5000 in 5% milk W/V TBST. Densitometry was performed using ImageJ and a student&amp;#39;s T test was used to determine statistical significance.  Rapamycin, Torin1, MLN0128, GDC0980, and nutrient starvation/re-stimulation treatments  For the mTOR inhibitor experiments, 3Ã—105 TREX cells per well were seeded into 6-well plates, grown for one day, treated with 100 nM rapamycin, 250 nM Torin1, 250 nM MLN0128, 250 nM GDC0980, or DMSO for 60 minutes. The cells were then lysed as above. For the nutrient deprivation experiments, 3Ã—105 TREX cells per well were seeded into 6-well plates, grown for one day, rinsed briefly in 1x amino acid- or glucose-free RPMI, incubated in 1x amino acid- or glucose-free RPMI for 60 minutes, and then stimulated with free amino acids or glucose to the levels in complete RPMI for 15 minutes.  In vitro proliferation assays  Six replicates each of 800-1200 cells were seeded into 96-well plates, treated with 8 doses of rapamycin 24 hours later, and assayed for ATP content using Cell Titer Glo 96 hours following rapamycin treatment according to the manufacturer&amp;#39;s protocol.  In vivo xenograft assays  3Ã—106 cells per injection site were implanted subcutaneously into the right and left flanks of nude mice. Once tumors were palpable in all animals (&amp;gt;50 mm3 volume by caliper measurements), mice were assigned randomly into rapamycin treated or untreated groups and caliper measurements were taken every 3-4 days until tumor burden approached the limits set by institutional guidelines. Tumor volume was assessed according to the formula (0.5)(W)(W)(L), and a student&amp;#39;s T test was used to determine the p-values. Rapamycin (4 mg/kg) or vehicle was delivered by daily IP injection, 100 mL per injection. All experiments involving mice were carried out with approval from the Committee for Animal Care at MIT and under supervision of the Department of Comparative Medicine at MIT.   Significance  We report that a diverse set of cancer-associated MTOR mutations confer increased mTORC1/2 pathway activity and that cells harboring these mutations are highly sensitive to rapamycin in culture and in vivo. These findings are clinically relevant as the MTOR mutations characterized herein may serve as biomarkers for predicting tumor responses to mTOR inhibitors.&quot;&gt;\n",
       "                Genes encoding components of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling axis are frequently mutated in cancer, but few mutations have been characterized in MTOR, the gene for the mTOR kinase. Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data, we generated a comprehensive catalog of mTOR pathway mutations in cancer, identifying 33 MTOR mutations that confer pathway hyperactivation. The mutations cluster in six distinct regions in the C-terminal half of mTOR and occur in multiple cancer types, with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney cancer. The activating mutations do not affect mTOR complex assembly, but a subset reduces binding to the mTOR inhibitor Deptor. mTORC1 signaling in cells expressing various activating mutations remains sensitive to pharmacological mTOR inhibition, but is partially resistant to nutrient deprivation. Lastly, cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations display heightened sensitivity to rapamycin both in culture and as in vivo xenografts, suggesting that such mutations confer mTOR pathway dependency.  Keywords: personalized, mTOR, mutations, biomarker, deptor Go to: Introduction In mammals, the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway regulates cell size, mRNA translation, autophagy and many metabolic processes, including lipid synthesis (1). A variety of upstream regulators control the activity of the serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR and many of these are deregulated in cancer, resulting in pathway hyperactivation. Such activation occurs most commonly through loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressors, such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), tuberous sclerosis 1/2 (TSC1/2), neurofibromin 1/2 (NF1/2), or oncogenic mutations in KRAS, PIK3CA, or AKT (2). However, few cancer-associated mutations have been functionally characterized in MTOR itself, with only two reports thus far describing such mutations. In the first report, the authors tested six cancer-associated MTOR mutations and observed that two (S2215Y from a colorectal sample and R2505P from a kidney sample) conferred mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activation (3). In the second report, the authors identified an mTORC1 activating MTOR mutation (L2431P) that was present in a portion but not the entirety of a primary kidney tumor (4). Although these initial reports establish that activating MTOR mutations do arise in cancer, they were based upon limited sample sets that do not reflect the diverse subtypes of cancer. More recently, cancer genome sequencing projects, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), have identified a vast number of somatic mutations in thousands of tumors from more than 40 cancer subtypes (5-7).  Using publicly available databases of cancer genome sequence data, we cataloged all mutations in mTOR pathway components. We annotated over 400 samples with missense mutations in the MTOR gene from dozens of cancer subtypes, most of which lie within six clusters in the part of the gene that encodes the C-terminal portion of mTOR. Furthermore, through functional analyses, we identify 33 novel mTOR pathway-activating mutations, some of which affect the capacity of mTOR to interact with its partner proteins. None of the activating mutations impact the sensitivity of mTORC1 activity in cells to mTOR inhibitors but a subset confer mTORC1 signaling resistance to nutrient deprivation. Importantly, cancer cells that naturally express a subset of the mutations are hypersensitive to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. These findings may have translational relevance as rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) are clinically approved for the treatment of cancer, and several ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitors are in development (8). As tumor biopsies are increasingly subjected to whole exome sequencing, the hyperactivating MTOR mutations we characterize may serve as biomarkers in predicting cancer response to mTOR-targeting drugs.  Go to: Results Catalog of recurring mutations in genes encoding mTOR pathway components  To generate a comprehensive catalog of all cancer-associated missense mutations in canonical genes of the mTOR pathway, we analyzed partial genome sequencing data from the TCGA, CCLE, International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) databases (5-7, 9, 10). This analysis revealed that almost every gene in the mTOR pathway harbored somatic point mutations (Supplementary Table 1). To enrich for mutations that are more likely to affect pathway function, only mutations that alter the same codon more than once were counted. When normalized for gene length, this analysis revealed that MTOR contained the highest percentage of recurring mutations, and thus we focused most of our attention on these mutations (Supplementary Figure 1). Collectively, through data mining and a literature search, we curated over 400 samples with non-synonymous MTOR point mutations (Figure 1B and Supplementary Table 2) (11-17). While the majority of these mutations are represented by only one sample in our database, approximately 40% are recurrent, most of which have not been previously described. Additionally, the mutations cluster in six distinct regions of mTOR centered on highly recurrent mutations that alter amino acids C1483, E1799, T1977, S2215, L2427 and R2505 (Figure 1C). The presence of these clusters suggests that there is a selective advantage to acquiring mutations in certain regions of the mTOR protein. Furthermore, these mutations are present in multiple cancer subtypes, with the highest number in colorectal, endometrial, and lung cancers, although these cancer subtypes are also considered to have the highest mutation rates (Figures 1D and 1E) (18). Interestingly, a random mutagenesis screen in the S. pombe mTOR homolog (tor2) identified activating mutations in homologous amino acid positions to many of those we find in MTOR to be recurrently mutated in cancer (19) (Supplementary Table 3).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Cancer-associated MTOR mutations mTORC1/2 activating mutations in MTOR  The prevalence of the recurrent mutations, their clustering, and correlation with activating tor2 mutations strongly suggested that the MTOR mutations impact mTOR pathway activity. To test this possibility, wild-type (WT) or ten different mutants of mTOR (L1460P, C1483F, E1799K, F1888L, T1977R, V2006I, S2215Y, I2500F, R2505P, and D2512H) were expressed in cells and phosphorylation of the mTORC1/2 substrates S6K1, 4EBP1, or Akt1 examined (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C). All the mTOR mutants conferred varying degrees of pathway activation, and, interestingly, a few displayed some substrate preference (L1460P, C1483F, S2215Y, and R2505P towards S6K1/4EBP1 or V2006I towards Akt1), implying that these mutations have greater effects on mTORC1 or mTORC2. Thus, while three pathway activating MTOR mutations have previously been identified (3, 4), our initial analyses uncovered an additional eight recurrent MTOR mutations which activate mTORC1 and/or mTORC2.  Figure 2 Figure 2 mTORC1 and mTORC2 activating mutations in MTOR and RHEB It is well established that two activating mutations (E545K and H1047R) within the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PI3K-p110Î±), encoded by the PIK3CA gene, can lead to mTOR pathway activation (20). To determine the degree of mTOR pathway activation conferred by mTOR mutation, S6K1 phosphorylation from cells expressing WT or S2215Y mTOR was compared to cells expressing WT or mutant PI3K-p110Î± (Supplementary Figures 2A and 2B). This revealed that while expression of only mutant mTOR conferred mTORC1 activation, expression of either WT or mutant PI3K-p110Î± induced mTORC1 activity.  Non-recurrent MTOR mutations that activate mTORC1 signaling  We next examined in more detail the nature of the activating MTOR mutations, and observed that while some codons are mutated to only one other residue (e.g. E1799K), others are mutated to several different amino acids (e.g. S2215F/P/T/Y). This is reminiscent of the diverse amino acids to which the G12 residue of KRAS is mutated in cancers (21). We expressed 20 such MTOR mutations and found that many (C1483R/W/Y, F1888I, T1977K, S2215F/P, I2500M), but not all (A41P/S/T, F1888V, T1977S, V2006L, S2215T, R2505Q/*, D2512G/Y), led to increased S6K1 phosphorylation (Supplementary Figures 3 and 5, and data not shown). Given that most of these activating mutations are found only once in our dataset implies that other non-recurrent mutations may also activate mTORC1 signaling. To identify other such mutations, we turned our attention to the mutational clusters identified in Figure 1, and observed that while most are represented by several tissue types, those in the C1483 cluster are particularly prevalent in kidney cancer (Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure 3D). Interestingly, two recent cancer genome sequencing efforts reported that kidney cancers have an increased percentage of mutations in mTOR pathway genes, but the functional consequences of these mutations were not evaluated (13, 22). Expression of the ten kidney cancer-associated MTOR mutations from the C1483 cluster revealed that in addition to the previously evaluated L1460P and C1483F/Y mutants (Figure 1B and Supplemental Figure 2), three non-recurrent mutants (L1433S, A1459P, and E1519T) also induced mTORC1 pathway activity (Figure 2D). Similarly, expression of eight non-recurrent mutations from the S2215 cluster (N2206S, L2209V, A2210P, L2216P, R2217W, L2220F, Q2223K, and A2226S) activated mTORC1 signaling as measured by S6K1 phosphorylation, with the L2209V mutant conferring higher activation than even S2215Y (Supplementary Figure 3E). Lastly, other than the S2215Y and R2505P mutations, the only other cancer-associated MTOR mutation previously characterized is L2431P from a kidney cancer patient (4). Expression of mTOR containing this non-recurrent mutation caused mTORC1 activation that was much weaker than that caused by expression of the S2215Y mutant (Supplementary Figure 3F). Collectively, these results suggest that while most non-recurrent MTOR mutations found in cancer are part of the mutational â€œnoiseâ€�, there exists a diverse set of MTOR mutations that can drive mTORC1 pathway activity. Likely, as more cancer genomes are sequenced, the activating non-recurrent mutations we identified will prove to be recurrent.  Recurrent mutations in RHEB activate mTORC1  We also observed that other mTOR pathway genes such as Raptor, Rictor, and Rheb1 harbored recurrent mutations (Supplemental Table 1). Expression of Rheb1 Y35N/C/H and to a lesser degree E139K increased phosphorylation of endogenous S6K1 more than that of WT Rheb1 (Figure 2E), while recurrent mutations in Raptor (R788C) or Rictor (S1101L) failed to induce any mTORC1 or mTORC2 activity (data not shown). In support of the relevance of these mutations to cancer, RHEB was recently highlighted as a novel cancer gene due to the presence of the Y35N mutation (23). Thus, cancer associated mutations in either MTOR or RHEB can induce mTORC1 activity; whether this is true of other mTOR pathway genes remains to be determined.  mTORC1/2 hyperactivating mutants bind less Deptor  One potential mechanism through which the mutations in mTOR (Figure 2) might increase S6K1/Akt1 phosphorylation is by altering mTORC1 or mTORC2 assembly. Alternatively or in addition, the mTOR mutations may diminish the binding of mTOR to its endogenous inhibitor Deptor, which binds to the FAT domain of mTOR (24). To test these possibilities, the interactions of exogenously expressed WT or mutant mTORs with endogenous Raptor, Rictor, and Deptor were measured. All mutant mTOR proteins bound equally well to Raptor and Rictor, suggesting that the mutations do not affect formation of either mTOR complex (Figure 3A). In contrast, Deptor binding to the immunoprecipitated mTOR proteins was reduced in cells expressing the mTOR mutants as compared to WT mTOR (Figure 3A). Given that increased mTOR pathway activity correlates with a reduction in the mTOR-Deptor interaction (24), it is likely that the observed decrease in Deptor binding reflects the increased mTOR pathway activity caused by the MTOR mutations. However, two mTORC1 activating mutations that are in the FAT domain of mTOR, L1460P and C1483Y, bound much less Deptor than the other mutants tested (Figure 3A), suggesting that these mutations directly perturb the Deptor binding site on mTOR. Consistent with this, examination of the mutations from the C1483 cluster described in figure 2D revealed that two other highly activating mutations in the FAT domain (A1459P and C1483Y) also strongly reduced the mTOR-Deptor interaction (Supplementary Figure 4A). While these results suggest a possible mechanism of action for a subset of activating mTOR mutations, they do not preclude other mechanism by which MTOR mutations may impact mTORC1 signaling, such as by increasing the activity of the mTOR kinase domain.  Figure 3 Figure 3 mTOR mutants bind less Deptor and cells expressing the mTOR S2215Y mutation are resistant to nutrient deprivation MTOR mutations do not affect mTORC1 sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors but can affect the pathway response to nutrient deprivation  We next considered the possibility that the mTORC1-activating MTOR mutants have altered sensitivity to established mTOR inhibitors. Engineered mutations in the FRB domain of mTOR, which binds the FKBP12-rapamycin complex, confer marked rapamycin resistance to mTOR (25). To test whether mTOR mutation alters pathway inhibition by rapamycin or Torin1 (an investigational ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor), we used HEK-293 cells with an integrated FLP recombination site (TREX cells) to stably express WT or several different mutants of mTOR (A1459P, C1483Y, E1799K, F1888I, L2209V, S2215Y, L2431P, I2500F, and R2505P), as the mTOR cDNA is too large to be packaged and expressed via a lentiviral delivery system (Supplementary Figure 4B). Baseline phosphorylation of endogenous S6K1 was higher in TREX cells expressing the A1459P, L2209V, S2215Y, I2500F and R2505P mTOR mutants than in parental or WT-expressing cells (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figures 4C and 4D), consistent with the results obtained upon transient expression of these mutants (Figures 2A and 2D, and Supplementary Figure 3D). Importantly, mTORC1 activity in none of the TREX cells was resistant to rapamycin, Torin1, MLN0128 (an mTOR ATP-competitive inhibitor), GDC0980 (a dual PI3K/mTOR ATP-competitive inhibitor), (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figures 4C and 4D). Thus, on a molecular level, while cells with mTOR mutations may display high levels of mTORC1/2 activity, this activity is still sensitive to pharmacological mTOR inhibition.  The kinase activity of mTOR is tightly regulated by nutrient availability; when cells are starved of nutrients (specifically glucose and amino acids), they downregulate mTORC1 signaling, while retreatment of cells with these nutrients restores mTORC1-mediated signaling (26). Given this, we sought to determine whether any of the activating mTOR mutants affect the sensitivity of mTORC1 signaling to amino acid or glucose withdrawal. Indeed, S6K1 phosphorylation was highly resistant to deprivation of either nutrient in cells expressing several mutants (A1459P, S2215Y, I2500F and R2505P) (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figures 4E and 4F). This observation may be relevant in the context of developing tumors, which are often glucose starved (27, 28), where inappropriate mTORC1 activity may provide a growth advantage.  Cancer cells with hyperactivating MTOR mutations are hypersensitive to rapamycin in vitro and in vivo  To determine if cancer cells with MTOR mutations are dependent on mTORC1 activity, we evaluated the impact of rapamycin on the proliferation of set of cancer cell lines harboring WT or mutant mTOR (Figure 4A). We identified four cell lines with mTORC1-activating MTOR mutations (C1483Y in MOLT16; E1799K in HEC59 and SNU349; and S2215Y in JHUEM7) and two with MTOR mutations that have no apparent impact on mTORC1 signaling (V2006L in TUHR10TKB; and R2152C in A375) (Supplementary Figures 5A and 5B). HeLa cells were used as a negative control cell line, as they are mildly rapamycin sensitive and are wild-type for mTOR (7, 29). MCF7 and SW780 cells, which are also wild-type for mTOR, served as positive controls for rapamycin sensitivity because the MCF7 cells harbor an activating PI3K-p110Î± mutation (E545K) while the SW780 cells lack NPRL2, which encodes a component of the GATOR1 negative regulator of the amino acid-sensing pathway (30, 31). Importantly, only the cell lines with activating MTOR mutations, the PI3K-p110Î± mutant, or the NPRL2-null SW780 cells were hypersensitive to rapamycin treatment (Figure 4B). Consistent with these and published results, the growth of HeLa xenografts was partially rapamycin sensitive, while rapamycin completely halted the growth of HEC59 xenografts, which carry the hyperactivating mTOR E1799K mutation (Figure 4C) (32, 33). These results suggest that the presence of hyperactivating MTOR mutations in cancer cells may serve as biomarkers to identify tumors that are likely to respond to mTOR inhibitors.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Rapamycin inhibits the proliferation of cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations Go to: Discussion Early cancer genome sequencing projects led to the identification of three mutations in MTOR that were shown to activate mTORC1 signaling (3, 4). Here, we have identified an additional 33 previously unknown activating MTOR mutations (some are recurrent, others are not) (Supplementary Table 4). Mechanistically, we find that the activating mutations diminish the mTOR-Deptor interaction and interestingly, when mapped onto the recently solved crystal structure of mTOR, the mutations cluster in several distinct locations within the protein itself, suggesting that other activating mechanisms may exist (Supplementary Figure 6) (34). While the mutations do not prevent pharmacological mTOR inhibition, a subset protect against the effects of nutrient deprivation on mTORC1 signaling. Lastly, we demonstrate that cell lines with activating MTOR mutations are particularly sensitive to rapamycin in cell culture and in xenografts, likely due to mTOR pathway dependency.  The diversity of activating MTOR mutations we characterized is reminiscent of the various activating mutations in the prototypical lipid kinase PIK3CA, which encodes for the PI3K catalytic subunit p110Î± (35). However, unlike the activating PIK3CA mutations, which confer equal activation of PI3K-mediated signaling pathways, the diverse MTOR mutations can differentially activate mTORC1 or mTORC2, leading to either S6K1/4EBP1 or Akt1 phosphorylation, respectively. This finding is particularly relevant in a clinical setting, as patients with mTORC1 activating mutations may respond well to FDA-approved rapalogs, while patients with mTORC2 activating mutations might best be treated with ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors, although such inhibitors are still in clinical trials. This distinction is especially relevant for patients with mTORC2 activating mutations, because rapalogs can in some cases upregulate mTORC2 signaling through modulation of an mTORC1-dependent feedback loop (36).  Rapalog-based therapies are currently approved or in clinical trials for several cancer subtypes, and some patients have had dramatic and durable responses to these therapies (37). Given that some cells with activating MTOR mutations are particularly rapamycin sensitive (Figure 4), it is possible that some of the rapalog-responsive patients had tumors with similar mutations. Indeed, it was recently found that the tumor of a bladder cancer patient with two activating MTOR mutations displayed exquisite sensitivity to rapalog-based therapy (38). Many more cancer-associated MTOR mutations will likely be identified in future studies, but functional evaluation of these mutations will be required to determine their impact on the mTOR pathway. As tumor sequencing becomes more commonplace, functional studies such as ours may aid in arriving at a more personalized treatment regimen that eventually promotes patient survival.  Go to: Methods Data acquisition and cluster analysis  All mutations in genes of the mTOR pathway were acquired from the cBIO, COSMIC, and ICGC databases or through a literature search with a data-freeze date of September 1, 2013. To identify regions of mTOR significantly enriched for somatic point mutations, we determined the probability of seeing at least the observed number of mutations in a 50 amino acid sliding window with the null hypothesis being all 463 MTOR mutations randomly occurring across the 2549 amino acid protein. Specifically, we calculated a threshold for significance of at least 15 mutations per 50 amino acids by the formula:  p=âˆ‘n=k463(463k)âˆ—(1âˆ’502549)463âˆ’kâˆ—(502549)k which equals 0.043 for k = at least 15 mutations per 50 amino acids.  Materials  Reagents were obtained from the following sources: antibodies to HA (clone C29F4), S6K1 (clone 49D7), phospho-T389-S6K1 (clone 108D2), and phospho-S473-Akt1 (clone D9E) from Cell Signaling Technology; antibody to GAPDH (clone GT239) from Genetex; antibodies to Deptor and Raptor, X-ray film, and PVDF membrane were from Millipore; antibody to Rictor from Bethyl; antibody to the Flag epitope (clone M2), Flag M2-coupled agarose beads, glucose and amino acid mixtures from Sigma; horseradish-peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; FuGENE HD and Cell Titer Glo from Promega; X-tremeGENE 9 and Complete Protease Mixture from Roche Applied Science; QuikChange II XL from Stratagene; enhanced chemiluminescence reagent and glutathione-coupled agarose beads from Thermo; 8-week-old nude mice from Taconic; rapamycin from LC Labs; MLN0128 and GDC0980 from Selleckchem; and Torin1 was synthesized in the Gray laboratory (39). cDNAs for mTOR and PI3K-p110Î± were from Addgene; expression vectors for HAGST-S6K1, HA-GST-Akt1, and HA-GST-Rheb1 were described previously (24, 40, 41) and Flag-14-3-3Î± was a generous gift from the Yaffe lab. The primers used to generate the mTOR and Rheb1 mutations were from Integrated DNA Technologies and are listed in supplemental table 5. HEK-293T-TREX cell system, 4-12% bis-tris SDS-PAGE gels, and 20x MOPS buffers were from Invitrogen.

All media was prepared with 10% heat inactivated FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. All cell lines were maintained at 37Â°C, 5% CO2.  Site-directed mutagenesis, cloning, and TREX cell line generation  All MTOR and RHEB point mutations were generated in the parental vectors using site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange II XL kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 5. Point mutations were verified using Sanger sequencing as conducted by Eton Biosciences. The HA-GST-4EBP1 reporter vector was generated by synthesizing a gBlock from IDT encoding for 4EBP1 and cloning it into the pRK5-HA-GST vector using SalI and NotI restriction digestion followed by ligation. WT and mutant mTOR cDNAs were subcloned directly from the pcDNA3 vector into the pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector using single site NotI restriction digestion followed by ligation. Flag-mTOR-expressing TREX cells were generated according to the manufacturer&amp;#39;s protocol.  Cell treatments, lysis, and immunoprecipitations  For S6K1 and Akt1 co-transfection assays, 3Ã—105 HEK-293T or HEK-293E cells per well were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates, transfected 24 hours later with 2 Î¼g of mTOR-encoding plasmid and 1 ng of S6K1- or Akt1-encoding plasmid using X-tremeGENE 9 or FuGENE HD, followed by whole cell lysis 48 hours after transfection in NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 substitute, 1 mM EDTA at pH8.0, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM Na-pyrophosphate, 15 mM Na3VO4, 100 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor per 50 mL of buffer). 200-400 Î¼g of whole cell lysates were mixed with 5x SDS-sample buffer to a final concentration of 1-2 Î¼g/Î¼L, boiled for 5 minutes, and then used directly for immunoblotting or frozen at âˆ’20Â°C. For glutathione pull down assays, 2Ã—106 HEK-293T cells were seeded onto 10 cm tissue culture plates, transfected 24 hours later with 10 Î¼g of mTOR-encoding plasmid and 2 ng of S6K1-encoding plasmid using X-tremeGENE 9, and lysed 48-72 hours after transfection in NP-40 lysis buffer. 2-3 mg of the resultant whole-cell lysates were incubated with 30 Î¼L of pre-washed glutathione-coupled agarose beads in a 1 mL volume, which were rotated at 4Â°C for two hours, spun at 2,500 RCF for one minute, washed in 500 Î¼L lysis buffer three times, and the beads directly boiled in 50 Î¼L of 2x SDS-sample buffer. For mTOR immunoprecipitations, the cells were treated as with the glutathione pulldown, except they were lysed/washed in CHAPS buffer (50 mM HEPES at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.4% CHAPS, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM Na-pyrophosphate, 100 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor per 50 mL of buffer) and incubated with Flag-M2-coupled agarose beads.  Immunoblotting  10-50 Î¼g of whole cell lysates, 10-30 Î¼L of glutathione pulldown samples, or 10-30 Î¼L of Flag-M2 immunoprecipitates were loaded into lanes of 4-12% bis-tris SDS-PAGE gels, run at 120 volts for 2 hours in 1x MOPS buffer, and then transferred to 0.45 Î¼m PVDF membrane at 60 volts for 2 hours in 1x transfer buffer (100 mM CAPS, 123 mM NaOH, 10% Ethanol). The membranes were then immunoblotted for the indicated proteins. All primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in 5% BSA W/V TBST, with the exception of GAPDH and Flag antibodies which were diluted 1:2000. All secondary antibodies were diluted 1:5000 in 5% milk W/V TBST. Densitometry was performed using ImageJ and a student&amp;#39;s T test was used to determine statistical significance.  Rapamycin, Torin1, MLN0128, GDC0980, and nutrient starvation/re-stimulation treatments  For the mTOR inhibitor experiments, 3Ã—105 TREX cells per well were seeded into 6-well plates, grown for one day, treated with 100 nM rapamycin, 250 nM Torin1, 250 nM MLN0128, 250 nM GDC0980, or DMSO for 60 minutes. The cells were then lysed as above. For the nutrient deprivation experiments, 3Ã—105 TREX cells per well were seeded into 6-well plates, grown for one day, rinsed briefly in 1x amino acid- or glucose-free RPMI, incubated in 1x amino acid- or glucose-free RPMI for 60 minutes, and then stimulated with free amino acids or glucose to the levels in complete RPMI for 15 minutes.  In vitro proliferation assays  Six replicates each of 800-1200 cells were seeded into 96-well plates, treated with 8 doses of rapamycin 24 hours later, and assayed for ATP content using Cell Titer Glo 96 hours following rapamycin treatment according to the manufacturer&amp;#39;s protocol.  In vivo xenograft assays  3Ã—106 cells per injection site were implanted subcutaneously into the right and left flanks of nude mice. Once tumors were palpable in all animals (&amp;gt;50 mm3 volume by caliper measurements), mice were assigned randomly into rapamycin treated or untreated groups and caliper measurements were taken every 3-4 days until tumor burden approached the limits set by institutional guidelines. Tumor volume was assessed according to the formula (0.5)(W)(W)(L), and a student&amp;#39;s T test was used to determine the p-values. Rapamycin (4 mg/kg) or vehicle was delivered by daily IP injection, 100 mL per injection. All experiments involving mice were carried out with approval from the Committee for Animal Care at MIT and under supervision of the Department of Comparative Medicine at MIT.   Significance  We report that a diverse set of cancer-associated MTOR mutations confer increased mTORC1/2 pathway activity and that cells harboring these mutations are highly sensitive to rapamycin in culture and in vivo. These findings are clinically relevant as the MTOR mutations characterized herein may serve as biomarkers for predicting tumor responses to mTOR inhibitors.\n",

       "            &lt;td class=&quot;fillremaining&quot; title=&quot;Frequent genetic alterations discovered in FGFRs and evidence implicating some as drivers in diverse tumors has been accompanied by rapid progress in targeting FGFRs for anticancer treatments. Wider assessment of the impact of genetic changes on the activation state and drug responses is needed to better link the genomic data and treatment options. We here apply a direct comparative and comprehensive analysis of FGFR3 kinase domain variants representing the diversity of point-mutations reported in this domain. We reinforce the importance of N540K and K650E and establish that not all highly activating mutations (for example R669G) occur at high-frequency and conversely, that some â€œhotspotsâ€� may not be linked to activation. Further structural characterization consolidates a mechanistic view of FGFR kinase activation and extends insights into drug binding. Importantly, using several inhibitors of particular clinical interest (AZD4547, BGJ-398, TKI258, JNJ42756493 and AP24534), we find that some activating mutations (including different replacements of the same residue) result in distinct changes in their efficacy. Considering that there is no approved inhibitor for anticancer treatments based on FGFR-targeting, this information will be immediately translatable to ongoing clinical trials.  Keywords: precision medicine, cancer mutations, receptor tyrosine kinases, small molecule inhibitors, resistance Go to: INTRODUCTION Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFR1-4) regulate a wide range of physiological processes including embryogenesis, wound healing, inflammation and angiogenesis as well as adult tissue homeostasis [1, 2]. Importantly, aberrant FGF/FGFR signaling has been linked to several developmental syndromes and a broad range of human malignancies [3, 4]. The involvement in the pathology of many cancer types provides a strong rationale for development of effective agents for these targets; consequently, there is a large ongoing effort to develop FGFR inhibitors as anticancer treatments [5, 6].  Recent applications of deep sequencing technologies have resulted in the discovery of frequent alterations in FGFR molecules; the alterations include point-mutations, overexpression and fusion genes [7â€“9]. Very recent analysis of about 5000 solid tumors provided a comprehensive picture of the FGFR alterations in cancer [10], generally consistent with the data combined from individual, smaller studies reported previously (examples include [11â€“17]). Based on these studies it is likely that FGFR aberrations occur in about 7% of solid tumors and almost every type of malignancy examined has been associated with FGFR aberrations; most commonly affected were urothelial, breast, endometrial, squamous lung cancers and ovarian cancer. The most frequently detected aberration appears to be gene amplification, in particular amplification of FGFR1, resulting in overexpression. Rearrangements resulting in fusion proteins (the most frequent being FGFR3TACC3-fusion) have been so far observed in smaller numbers compared to amplifications and mutations. Point-mutations have been detected in all FGFRs and are likely to represent about one third of all aberrations; they appear to be more frequent in FGFR3 and FGFR2 compared with FGFR1 and FGFR4.  The field of FGFR targeting has progressed rapidly in recent years especially owing to the further evaluation of nonselective and the development of novel FGFR-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), many of which are currently in clinical trials [6]. The most clinically advanced compounds are nonselective TKIs (including ponatinib, brivanib, nintedanib, lenvatinib, dovitinib and lucitanib) that also have inhibitory activity against some other RTKs (such as VEGFRs). However, accumulative side effects and a modest efficacy of some of these compounds towards FGFRs have prompted the development of selective and highly potent FGFR TKIs, including AZD4547, BGJ-398 and JNJ42756493 [18â€“20]. It is also becoming apparent that optimal therapeutic application of FGFR inhibitors requires knowledge of the molecular profiles of populations that will benefit most from these drugs. Data providing information about the rates and types of FGFR aberrations in a variety of cancer types, as summarized above, will no doubt help to aid design of clinical trials.  The next rate-liming step to understand the clinical implications of such abundant genomic data, however, is the wider assessment of the causative role of these alterations found in cancer; the impact on protein function, including activation state and drug responses, needs to be assessed. In particular, point mutations occur in all regions of the receptor molecules including extracellular, trans-membrane and kinase domains of FGFR1-4, suggesting diverse outcomes and mechanisms [7, 9]. Several pre-clinical studies focusing on some of the frequently observed mutations demonstrated their oncogenic potential. For example, FGFR3 extracellular S249C substitution that occurs in more than 70% of urothelial tumors harboring mutations has been shown to enhance receptor phosphorylation, downstream signaling, saturation density in urothelial cells and to induce transformation of mouse fibroblasts [21]. Furthermore, viability and proliferation of some cancer cell lines with the FGFR3 S249C substitution was compromised by FGFR inhibitors including the FGFR-specific AZD4547 compound [22]. Among FGFR kinase domain (KD) cancer mutations, another FGFR3 activating mutation, K650E, has been most extensively characterized [14, 21, 23]. However, to our knowledge, there is to date no comprehensive study in which different FGFR cancer variants have been directly compared and the impact of mutations assessed quantitatively. Furthermore, it is not clear how different primary or acquired mutations can affect responses to the emerging clinically promising inhibitors, including a number of nonselective and selective TKIs. Because all currently tested TKIs inhibit receptor kinase activity by interfering with the binding of ATP or substrates of the tyrosine kinase domain, mutations occurring within this domain are likely to be particularly relevant in this context. With these aims in mind, here we describe the effect of FGFR KD mutations on kinase activity, using a comprehensive panel, and distinct signatures of drug efficacy for different activating FGFR variants.  Go to: RESULTS Reported mutations in FGFR KD  To obtain a comprehensive insight into mutations affecting the intracellular portion (and in particular KD) of FGFRs, we compiled missense mutation data and performed multiple sequence and structure-based analyses (Figure (Figure1,1, Supplementary Table S1).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Point mutations in the intracellular region of FGFR The intracellular portion (residues 397-806 for FGFR3) comprises the juxtamembrane region, KD and C-terminal regions. The number of observed mutations at each residue within the intracellular portion of FGFR3 was compiled from several cancer databases (COSMIC, TCGA, ICGC and BioMuta) covering all cancer types (Figure (Figure1A,1A, top). Considering the high degree of similarity between FGFR1-4, the same analysis was also performed for all FGFRs and displayed using amino acid numbering for FGFR3 (Figure (Figure1A,1A, bottom). Two frequently mutated positions (â€œhotspotsâ€�) were identified in FGFR3 KD in cancer (K650 and G697) and a third (corresponding to N540 in FGFR3) was revealed only when considering all FGFRs (Figure (Figure1A).1A). The most frequent amino acid replacements at the position corresponding to FGFR3 K650 were E and M while others such as N, Q and T were observed less frequently. For the position corresponding to FGFR3 N540, the most frequent mutation was to K compared to S, D or H. The frequent replacement G697C was reported only for FGFR3 (Figure (Figure1A1A).  It has been previously highlighted that a number of cancer mutations, in particular in FGFR2 and FGFR3, have also been described in various developmental syndromes such as bone dysplasia [4]. Positions mutated in FGFR3 in this type of dysplasia (Figure (Figure1B1B top) included not only one of the hotspots observed in FGFR3 in cancer (K650) (Figure (Figure1A1A top) but also the N540 hotspot position (Figure (Figure1A1A bottom). N540 FGFR3 mutations in bone dysplasia reflect the overall picture of FGFR1-4 mutations in cancer with the replacement N540K being the most frequently observed [24](Figure ](Figure1B1B top). A distinct pattern of cancer mutations in FGFR1-4 can reflect differences in cancer types and their etiology, with FGFR3 mutations being most prevalent in a single cancer type (i.e bladder cancer) [7â€“9].  Comparison of positions mutated in bone dysplasia in all FGFRs with those reported for FGFR3 in cancer (Figure (Figure1B,1B, bottom) highlighted common residues including I538, N540, K650 and R669. With respect to the secondary structure (Figure (Figure1C),1C), I538 and N540 are in the Î±C-Î²4 linker, K650 in the activation (A)-loop and R669 in Î±EF-Î²12 linker. The hot spot position G697 has not been observed in bone dysplasia in any of FGFRs and is present within the Î±F- Î±G linker.  A number of crystal structures of FGFR KD in non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms have been reported [25]. The 3D-structures highlighted the features that undergo substantial changes and play a key role in the activation process; of particular importance is the A-loop and so called â€œmolecular brakeâ€� (Figure (Figure1D,1D, Supplementary Figure S1). When positions of FGFR3 cancer mutations are highlighted in the FGFR KD structure, one hot spot (K650) and 9 other residues are present within the A-loop while R669 is in its vicinity. Residues N540 and I538 are part of the molecular brake.  In a broader context, linking genetic data with the functional outcome remains a challenge and the accuracy is such that most predictions should be seen as complementary to - rather than a replacement for - experimental evaluation [26, 27]. In addition to ranking based on observed mutation frequencies, there are a number of bioinformatics tools that can assess the possible impacts of a mutation (Supplementary Table S1A, Supplementary Figure S2). Many algorithms assume that mutations affecting protein function occur at evolutionarily conserved sites and the meta-predictor CONsensus DELeteriousness score (Condel) combines several of these [28]. More sophisticated predictors make use of available protein structures (such as SAAP, that predicts outcomes using multiple features, or 3D-clustering). Some structure-based tools allow prediction of the energetic impacts of mutations; we used FOLDX [29] to predict changes in stability for all possible FGFR3 KD mutations and ranked them. Stability differences between active and inactive KD can predict mutations expected to shift equilibrium from inactive to active conformations.  We used these tools for analysis of all reported intracellular FGFR3 cancer mutations and also included some common mutations found in other FGFRs or in bone dysplasia. Based on this, we constructed a representative panel for experimental evaluation that covers different structural elements of the KD, frequencies, cancer types and different prediction outcomes (Table (Table1).1). The panel includes about 47% of all intracellular residues reported to be mutated in FGFR3 in cancer.  Table 1 Table 1 Panel of FGFR3 variants selected for experimental studies Kinase activity of FGFR3 KD variants  The number of cancer mutations in FGFR KDs that have been comprehensively assessed for their functional impact is limited, with the most emphasis being on replacements at positions corresponding to FGFR3 K650 and mutation corresponding to FGFR3 N540K [14, 21, 23, 30, 31]. Some comparisons of mutations found in the context of bone dysplasia have also been reported [32â€“34]. However, very few studies compared a panel of cancer mutations or directly and quantitatively measured kinase activity; no such studies have been applied to FGFR3 KD.  Isolated FGFR KDs undergo auto-phosphorylation on several tyrosine residues and this property correlates well with the kinase activity towards natural and synthetic substrates. We used purified proteins of 26 FGFR3 KD variants to directly compare the impact of different mutations on FGFR3 KD auto-phosphorylation (Figure (Figure2A).2A). The most frequent mutations at the hotspot positions, K650E and N540K, resulted in a large increase (up to 45-fold) in auto-phosphorylation. Interestingly, at both positions, the mutations observed less frequently, K650N and N540S, were also less activating. However, surprisingly, the most activating mutation in this assay was a non-hotspot mutation R669G. Another replacement at this position, R669Q, also resulted in an increase of auto-phosphorylation. The least activating among variants that increased FGFR3 KD auto-phosphorylation more than 7-fold was the I538V mutation. Results from further analysis of these activating variants in a substrate phosphorylation assay (Figure (Figure2B,2B, top panel) were generally consistent with the auto-phosphorylation data (Figure (Figure2A2A).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Kinase activity of selected FGFR3 variants harboring point mutations Several other mutations, including V555M, D641G and D641N resulted in an increase of auto-phosphorylation up to 7-fold (Figure (Figure2A)2A) and a similar increase in substrate phosphorylation (Figure (Figure2B,2B, middle panel). The V555M mutation, unlike other mutations in this panel, is an acquired resistance mutation to an FGFR inhibitor (AZ12908010) where the gatekeeper residue, V555, is replaced by a larger side-chain residue [22]. Gatekeeper mutations have been described in many kinases and several studies have shown an associated increase in kinase activity [35â€“37].  Twelve out of 26 analyzed mutations had very little or no effect on FGFR3 KD activity (Figure (Figure2A2A and and2B,2B, bottom panel). The number of observations in cancer for most of these mutations is low with the exception of G697C that represents one of the hotspots (Figure (Figure1A1A).  Two mutations, D617G and G637W, completely abolished kinase activity (Figure (Figure2A2A and and2B,2B, bottom panel). Both residues are strongly conserved among protein kinases and some of the replacements of these residues in various kinases have been tested and shown to result in inactivation [38, 39]. D617 is the key catalytic residue and part of the HRD motif in the C-loop, while G637 resides in the A-loop as a part of the DFG motif. The DFG motif is surprisingly frequently mutated in the cancer kinome [38]. However, a G to W replacement has not been observed and tested previously and, as shown in Figure Figure2B2B (bottom panel), also results in kinase inactivation. In general, the importance of these inactivating mutations for cancer development remains unclear and specifically for FGFRs it could be linked to their suggested, context-dependent tumour protective functions [40].  From these direct measurements of kinase activity it seems that a considerable number of mutations reported so far result in kinase activation to some degree and that replacements that cause activation are not limited to hotspot positions (Figures (Figures2A2A and and2B).2B). However, the comparison of a highly activating K650E and phosphorylated WT FGFR3 KD suggests that even these mutations do not fully convert mutated molecules to their active conformations (Figure (Figure2C2C).  It could be expected that some mutations that map to the KD do not affect kinase activity directly as measured under conditions in vitro. In particular, the hotspot G697C mutation which does not have an effect in such assays (Figure (Figure2A2A and and2B,2B, bottom panel) could impact on FGFR3 function in a way that can only be detected in a cellular setting. To test this possibility, a stably transfected FGFR3 G697C NIH3T3 cell line was compared with cell lines expressing two other hotspot variants, K650E and N540K, and the WT FGFR3 cell line (Figure (Figure3).3). In contrast to cell lines expressing FGFR3 K650E and N540K mutations, FGFR3 G697C NIH3T3 cell line did not show a transformed phenotype (Figure (Figure3A)3A) or anchorage independent growth (Figure (Figure3B);3B); there was no detectable increase in downstream phosphorylation events and levels of phospho-FGFR were comparable to the WT (Figure (Figure3C3C).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Analysis of G697C substitution in a cellular setting Analysis of the FGFR3 R669G NIH3T3 cell line has shown that despite low expression levels, downstream signaling appeared to be enhanced as well as FGFR3 phosphorylation (Figure (Figure4A4A).  Figure 4 Figure 4 Impact of R669G substitution on function of FGFR3 in a cellular setting and on FGFR KD structure Comparison of our experimental data (Figure (Figure2)2) with the assessments obtained using bioinformatics tools (Supplementary Table S1B and S1C) suggests that considering multiple methods together can provide insight into the influences of many panel mutations. Condel predicts three pathogenic mutations (E466K, D617G and G637W) that either reduce protein production or completely inactivate the kinase. Stabilization of active kinase is indicated by FOLDX with good specificity, but low sensitivity. However, most highly activating or moderately activating mutations have supporting evidence from either FOLDX or clustering (Supplementary Table S1B, Supplementary Figure S2). In particular, although not a hotspot, R669 is within an identified cluster of observed A-loop cancer mutations.  Activation mechanism of FGFR3 R669G mutation  The residue corresponding to R669 in FGFR3 is conserved and also mutated in all other FGFRs in cancer as well as in FGFR2 in bone dysplasia (Supplementary Table S1). To assess the mechanism that underpins activation, we first analyzed the R to G replacement in the context of FGFR1 KD that is more amenable to crystallography compared to FGFR3 KD. As shown in Figure Figure4B,4B, R675G FGFR1 KD variant also has higher activity compared to the WT. X-ray data collection and refinement statistics for the R675G FGFR1 KD 3D structure are summarized in Supplementary Table S2.  Comparison of this new FGFR1 R675G KD structure (Figure (Figure4C,4C, top) with inactive (apo) FGFR1 KD (PDB: 4UWY) and active, FGFR1-3P (pdb 3GQI) (Figure (Figure4C,4C, bottom) structures shows that FGFR1 R675G KD differs from the inactive form and adopts a fold with great similarity to the active KD. Notably, in the inactive FGFR1 KD there is direct hydrogen bonding between R675 and H650 from the A-loop; in addition, R675 is found to share a tight van der Waals interaction with active site tyrosine Y653 and H650 (Figure (Figure4C,4C, bottom left inset). These interactions are disturbed and broken in R675G mutant (Figure (Figure4C,4C, top inset), thus favoring the A-loop to adopt an open conformation as found in the active FGFR1-3P (Figure (Figure4C,4C, bottom right inset). In turn, this open conformation of the A-loop leads to several rearrangements of various control elements in the KD â€“ including ordering of spine residues, dissociation in the molecular brake interacting residues, repositioning of the Î±C-helix and movement of the N-lobe toward the C-lobe.  To gain further insight into the activation mechanism of the R669G mutation in FGFR3, we performed NMR studies in which we compared the backbone amide chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) associated with the R669G mutation with those of the WT FGFR3 KD. Our results show that in addition to localized differences around the mutation, there are other differences in distant elements, consistent with a broader conformational change (Supplementary Figure S3). Of particular note are the significant CSPs in the Î±C-Î²4 loop and at the C-terminal end of the Î±C-helix, which likely report on the release of the molecular brake by the R669G mutation. The CSPs in helix Î±G and in the Î±F-Î±G linker also suggest altered interactions with the Î±EF helix and the activation loop, consistent with promotion of an active conformation.  Previous structural studies of FGFR2 KD highlighted a long-range allosteric communication linking the kinase hinge, the Î±C-helix and the A-loop [41]. It was also illustrated that some A-loop mutations (such as FGFR3 K650E), by forcing an active conformation of the loop, can change via this allosteric network the position of the Î±C-helix and also dissociate the molecular brake [23, 41]. We suggest a similar allosteric mechanism for FGFR1 R675G and corresponding FGFR3 R669G mutation that is in this case triggered by the loss of inhibitory interactions in the vicinity of the A-loop that involve the R675/669 residue.  Structural insights into drug binding  Several recent structural studies revealed binding pockets of some selective (BGJ-398 and AZD4547) and non-selective (TKI258 and AP24534) FGFR inhibitors in complexes with FGFR1 KD [37, 42, 43]. For the FGFR-selective inhibitor JNJ42756493 there is much less reported information despite its promise for clinical use [44]. To help rationalize functional differences between these compounds we generated the structure of FGFR1 in complex with JNJ42756493 by soaking the compound into preformed crystals of FGFR1 KD in which there are two molecules of FGFR1 in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The two monomers are highly similar, exhibiting rmsd values of 0.39 Ã… over 280 Ã… and 0.09 Ã… over 39 Ã… within 6 Ã… of the JNJ42756493 binding site. Further discussion will therefore refer to the structure of monomer A. The overall structure of FGFR1 KD bound to JNJ42756493 is shown in Figure Figure5A5A.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Structural insights into JNJ42756493 binding to FGFR1 KD JNJ42756493 occupies the ATP-binding cleft of FGFR1 largely as expected on the basis of previous complexes between FGFR1 and other type-I inhibitors (e. g. BJG-398, AZD4547, PD173074 and TKI258) and where the activation loop clearly exhibits a DFG-in conformation. The quinoxaline core of JNJ42756493 is observed to form a single hydrogen bond to the hinge region via the main chain amide of A564 while the dimethoxyphenyl ring is orientated perpendicular to the quinoxaline core and occupies the hydrophobic pocket located behind the gatekeeper residue (V561). One of the methoxy oxygen atoms is involved in a hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogen atom of the DFG aspartate (D641). The methyl pyrazole solubilizing group extends away from the hinge region towards the solvent channel and does not make any specific interactions with the protein. A structural comparison of various drug compounds (JNJ42756493, BGJ-398, AZD4547, TKI258 and AP24534; Supplementary Figure S4) bound to FGFR1 KD clearly indicates that a unique feature of JNJ42756493 is the amide side chain which extends into the region of the binding site normally occupied by the a-phosphate of ATP where it forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain of D641. In addition the terminal isopropyl group of this side chain also makes good van der Waals interactions with the protein in a shallow pocket formed by the side chains of N628, L630, A640 and D641 that has previously been referred to as the â€œpitâ€� region [45]. Interestingly this indentation in FGFR1 has previously been found to be occupied by a methyl isoxazole moiety in a series of compounds containing a pyrazole core (PDB numbers: 4F64, 4F65, 4NK9, 4NKA and 4NKS). The side chain modification to JNJ42756493 therefore likely makes a significant contribution to its overall binding strength and specificity. Considering that JNJ42756493, BGJ-398, AZD4547, TKI258 and AP24534 are all in clinical trials, structural comparison of their binding to FGFR KD (Supplementary Figure S4) will contribute to understanding their clinical differences.  Changes in drug efficacy due to activating mutations  It is well established that some acquired mutations in protein kinases greatly reduce drug binding; the best-illustrated examples are gatekeeper mutations also described in FGFR3 (V555M) [22, 37]. The question of how primary mutations in FGFR KDs, in particular activating mutations, affect drug efficacy has not been addressed directly although studies of FGFR2 resistance mutations to TKI258 using BaF3 cells suggested this possibility [46]. However, with a number of FGFR inhibitors now in clinical trials it is important to establish accurately their comparative efficacies towards different FGFR variants.  We performed measurements of Ki for AZD4547, BGJ-398, TKI258, JNJ42756493 and AP24534 using purified FGFR3 KD WT and variants R669G, K650E, N540S, N540K, V555M and I538V (Figure (Figure6,6, Supplementary Table S3). Ki values for the WT FGFR3 KD show the first direct comparison of these compounds (Figure (Figure6A);6A); several previous studies focused on a single drug [18, 19, 47]. JNJ42756493 is the most effective (Ki about 2 nM), closely followed by AZD4547 (Ki about 4.5 nM) while another FGFR-specific inhibitor BGJ-398 has a Ki value similar to pan-kinase inhibitors TKI258 and AP24534 (within the range 65-95 nM) (Figure (Figure6A,6A, Supplementary Table S3). Mutations selected for this study include the gatekeeper (V555M) and several other activating mutations that are in the vicinity of the ATP binding pocket (N540S, N540K and I538V); R669G and K650E mutations are further away â€“ however, they could have an allosteric effect (Figure (Figure6B6B).  Figure 6 Figure 6 Inhibitor efficacy for a subset of FGFR3 variants measured in vitro and in cells The impact of each mutation on drug binding is expressed as a fold-difference in Ki compared to the FGFR3 KD WT (Figure (Figure6C).6C). Highly activating R669G and, in particular, hotspot mutation K650E had moderate effects on the efficacy of all inhibitors; all changes for K650E were within 4â€“fold (Figure (Figure6C,6C, Supplementary Table S3). In contrast, mutations at the hotspot position N540 had a more pronounced effect (up to 23-fold) and most affected the compounds with low Ki values, with the N540K substitution affecting AZD4547 more and N540S affecting JNJ42756493 more. As expected, the gatekeeper V555M mutation, conferring resistance to AZ12908010 (similar to AZD4547), had an impact on the efficacy of AZD4547 (about 20-fold). The change in efficacy of JNJ42756493 due to V555M mutation was even greater (about 200-fold) representing the biggest change observed in this panel. Interestingly, as we reported previously [37], the affinity of TKI258 for V555M was higher compared to the WT. Residue I538 is in contact with N540 in the 3D structure [41] and the mutation I538V had substantial effect (up to 40-fold) on all inhibitors.  We further compared the effect of the two most potent FGFR-specific inhibitors AZD4547 and JNJ42756493 on hotspot mutations K650E and N540K in NIH3T3 cell lines. As previously reported [37] and shown in Supplementary Figure S5 NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with the â€œemptyâ€� expression vector are only marginally affected by FGFR inhibitors. An NIH3T3 cell line expressing FGFR3TACC3-fusion protein was used for comparison with the K650E and N540K NIH3T3 cell lines because the FGFR3 KD in this fusion has the WT sequence and, furthermore, this cell line has similarly transformed phenotype (Figure (Figure6D).6D). For the WT KD, AZD4547 and JNJ42756493 cellular IC50s reflect the in vitro differences of about 2-3 fold (Figure (Figure6D,6D, left and Supplementary Table S3). The K650E and N540K variants reduce efficacy of both compounds with the larger impact by the N540K mutation also showing a considerable difference between AZD4547 and JNJ42756493 for this mutant (Figure (Figure6D,6D, middle and right).  Some of the differences between the effects of tested inhibitors on activating FGFR variants (Figure (Figure6)6) are consistent with observations from structural studies. Based on the crystal structure of FGFR1 KD V561M, the interactions of the inhibitors within the ATP-binding pocket, and their chemical structures (Supplementary Figure S1), it is expected that the efficacy of the JNJ42756493 towards FGFR3 V555M would be particularly affected. Contributing factors include the higher rigidity of this compound, compared with AZD4547 and BGJ-398, and the nature of occupancy of the ATP-binding pocket resulting in higher affinity (Figure (Figure5,5, Supplementary Figure S1). In general, 3D structures alone are not sufficient to fully understand the mode and strength of drug binding [48] highlighting the importance of direct measurements performed here.  Go to: DISCUSSION Many clinically relevant cancer mutations were identified based on recurrence rates. However, this strategy cannot be readily applied to alterations that occur in a minority of tumors or to situations where different, rare mutations create the same neoplastic phenotype via different mechanisms. In fact, some of these mutations are of functional significance and likely constitute drivers, therapeutic targets or mechanisms of therapy resistance [49]. Here we have applied a direct comparative analysis of FGFR KD variants that represent the diversity of all mutations found in cancer and characterized their impact on kinase activity; for a subset of activating mutations we have also established their responsiveness to several drugs of particular clinical interest.  Our data reinforce the importance of frequently observed mutations at positions corresponding to FGFR3 N540 and K650 that occur in different FGFRs and in a range of cancer types as well as in bone dysplasia (Figures (Figures11â€“3, Supplementary Table S1) [7, 9, 24]. In particular, replacements N to K and K to E at the respective positions are highly activating in vitro and transforming in NIH3T3 cells (Figures (Figures22 and and3).3). In contrast, we have not been able to provide supporting evidence for an activating nature of FGFR3 mutation G697C (Figure (Figure22 and and3).3). A relatively high number of observations of this mutation highlight FGFR3 G697C as another hotspot mutation (Figure (Figure1).1). However, all observations of FGFR3 G697C were reported in a single study of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) [50]. It is possible that the activating potential of this mutation could be context dependent and involve interaction with another component(s) present in this type of epithelial cells. Interestingly, another study examining a comparable number of OSCC cases from a different population failed to detect FGFR3 G697C, arguing that this mutation is unlikely to be common even in this cancer type [51]. It is also conceivable that the occurrence of this mutation in a specific population could be unrelated to FGFR activation and involvement in OSCC. Further studies, focusing on FGFR3 G697C in epithelial cells rather than on comparative analysis shown here, would be needed to confirm this possibility.  A number of non-hotspot mutations have an impact on kinase activity, mainly resulting in moderate activation (Figure (Figure2).2). At least some of these mutations are likely to have clinical relevance and they include a gatekeeper mutation (FGFR3 V555M) and a mutation (corresponding to FGFR3 I538V) also identified in a developmental disorder (hypochondroplasia) (Supplementary Table S1). The importance of mutations resulting in a lower degree of activation has been illustrated in developmental disorders, linking these mutations to less severe syndromes [52]; it is also possible that they could contribute to generation or progression of tumors or may be selected for after the selective pressure of anti-FGFR treatments. Moreover, we have established that an infrequent cancer mutation corresponding to R669G in FGFR3, also found in bone dysplasia, greatly enhances kinase activity of FGFR (Figures (Figures11 and and2).2). One observation that could be related to its low reported frequency in cancer is the finding of low expression levels of this mutation in transfected mammalian cells (compared to FGFR3 N540K, K650E or WT) (Figure (Figure4)4) that might compromise its impact or could require additional changes in cancer cells to increase its stability or expression. Nevertheless, structural studies of this mutation in the context of FGFR1 KD (R675G) are fully consistent with its activating potential. Furthermore, we here reveal a new feature of FGFR KD that stabilizes the inactive conformation which, when disrupted by mutations, can result in activation â€“ namely, a set of interactions in the vicinity of the A-loop that involve R669/675 (Figure (Figure4).4). Our new structural insights also consolidate observations resulting from structural studies of several other activating variants including FGFR2 N549H/T mutations in the molecular brake, FGFR2 K659N and FGFR3 K650E in the A-loop and FGFR1 V651M gatekeeper mutation affecting the regulatory spine [23, 37, 41]. Although R669/675 and these other mutations affect different regions in FGFR KD, the local structural changes trigger alterations in FGFR KD allosteric networks resulting in a shift towards conformations resembling an active form of phosphorylated kinase.  Combined with several recent structural studies of inhibitory compounds bound to FGFR KDs [37, 42, 43], our crystal structure of the JNJ42756493/FGFR1 KD complex provides a detailed picture of common features and key differences in the extent and nature of their binding interactions (Figure (Figure5,5, Supplementary Figure S4). While these structures provide an important basis for understanding and improving the function of FGFR inhibitors, there are also limitations, in particular understanding the consequence of specific FGFR mutations requires direct experimental assessment. Indeed, our direct measurements of Ki values in vitro and evaluation of effects in cells show a complex picture where different mutations, including replacements of the same residue, can have very profound effects on the efficacy of some inhibitors but not on others (Figures (Figures6C6C and and6D).6D). In the case of FGFR3 acquired gatekeeper mutation (V555M), this is illustrated by about 200-fold reduction in efficacy for JNJ42756493 and an increase in efficacy for TKI258 (Figure (Figure6C).6C). Considering a good correlation between in vitro and in vivo effects of FGFR inhibitors in our previous study [37], these data are likely to be relevant for a cellular setting. Consistent with the in vitro data, we have observed loss of efficacy for PD173074 with the effect of TKI258 retained following introduction of FGFR3 V555M mutation in a cell line originally responding to both drugs [37]. Because JNJ42756493 is also effective towards FGFR4 [20], these findings could be important when considering the use of JNJ42756493 as a first-line treatment; primary, activating mutations corresponding to gatekeeper replacements have been reported in rhabdomyosarcoma (FGFR4 V550L and V550E) and in breast cancer (FGFR4 V550M) [16, 38]. Another example that could inform the use of FGFR-selective inhibitors in the clinic is the effect of the hotspot N540K mutation on JNJ42756493 and AZD4547 that shows a larger impact on AZD4547 both in vitro and in cells (Figures (Figures6C6C and and6D).6D). Differential responses (response to TKI258 and AP24534 compared with reduced sensitivity to PD173074) due to the mutation corresponding to N540K, introduced in FGFR2 in the context of the JHUEM-2 cancer cell line, have been previously observed [46].  For aberrations where the FGFR KD retains the WT sequence (such as overexpression and a number of fusion proteins) the efficacy of both JNJ42756493 and AZD4547 could be expected to be high, as we illustrate here using the WT protein in vitro and FGFR3TACC3-fusion in cells (Figures (Figures6A6A and and6D).6D). More broadly, previous assessments of efficacy of several FGFR-specific inhibitors in separate studies have shown a good response in cancers with gene amplification of the FGFR WT or fusion proteins; these studies were based on available panels of cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts [22, 42, 53â€“55]. However, there are only a few cancer cell lines harboring point mutations in the FGFR KD with just two mutations being represented, FGFR3 K650E and FGFR2 N550K. Due to various changes that co-occur with FGFR mutations in each of these cell lines, it was difficult to assess and compare their responses and obtain conclusive data. Therefore, our studies of drug efficacy performed in vitro and in stable cell lines, complement and expand these previous assessments and reveal differential, drug-specific impacts of different FGFR KD mutations.&quot;&gt;\n",
       "                Frequent genetic alterations discovered in FGFRs and evidence implicating some as drivers in diverse tumors has been accompanied by rapid progress in targeting FGFRs for anticancer treatments. Wider assessment of the impact of genetic changes on the activation state and drug responses is needed to better link the genomic data and treatment options. We here apply a direct comparative and comprehensive analysis of FGFR3 kinase domain variants representing the diversity of point-mutations reported in this domain. We reinforce the importance of N540K and K650E and establish that not all highly activating mutations (for example R669G) occur at high-frequency and conversely, that some â€œhotspotsâ€� may not be linked to activation. Further structural characterization consolidates a mechanistic view of FGFR kinase activation and extends insights into drug binding. Importantly, using several inhibitors of particular clinical interest (AZD4547, BGJ-398, TKI258, JNJ42756493 and AP24534), we find that some activating mutations (including different replacements of the same residue) result in distinct changes in their efficacy. Considering that there is no approved inhibitor for anticancer treatments based on FGFR-targeting, this information will be immediately translatable to ongoing clinical trials.  Keywords: precision medicine, cancer mutations, receptor tyrosine kinases, small molecule inhibitors, resistance Go to: INTRODUCTION Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFR1-4) regulate a wide range of physiological processes including embryogenesis, wound healing, inflammation and angiogenesis as well as adult tissue homeostasis [1, 2]. Importantly, aberrant FGF/FGFR signaling has been linked to several developmental syndromes and a broad range of human malignancies [3, 4]. The involvement in the pathology of many cancer types provides a strong rationale for development of effective agents for these targets; consequently, there is a large ongoing effort to develop FGFR inhibitors as anticancer treatments [5, 6].  Recent applications of deep sequencing technologies have resulted in the discovery of frequent alterations in FGFR molecules; the alterations include point-mutations, overexpression and fusion genes [7â€“9]. Very recent analysis of about 5000 solid tumors provided a comprehensive picture of the FGFR alterations in cancer [10], generally consistent with the data combined from individual, smaller studies reported previously (examples include [11â€“17]). Based on these studies it is likely that FGFR aberrations occur in about 7% of solid tumors and almost every type of malignancy examined has been associated with FGFR aberrations; most commonly affected were urothelial, breast, endometrial, squamous lung cancers and ovarian cancer. The most frequently detected aberration appears to be gene amplification, in particular amplification of FGFR1, resulting in overexpression. Rearrangements resulting in fusion proteins (the most frequent being FGFR3TACC3-fusion) have been so far observed in smaller numbers compared to amplifications and mutations. Point-mutations have been detected in all FGFRs and are likely to represent about one third of all aberrations; they appear to be more frequent in FGFR3 and FGFR2 compared with FGFR1 and FGFR4.  The field of FGFR targeting has progressed rapidly in recent years especially owing to the further evaluation of nonselective and the development of novel FGFR-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), many of which are currently in clinical trials [6]. The most clinically advanced compounds are nonselective TKIs (including ponatinib, brivanib, nintedanib, lenvatinib, dovitinib and lucitanib) that also have inhibitory activity against some other RTKs (such as VEGFRs). However, accumulative side effects and a modest efficacy of some of these compounds towards FGFRs have prompted the development of selective and highly potent FGFR TKIs, including AZD4547, BGJ-398 and JNJ42756493 [18â€“20]. It is also becoming apparent that optimal therapeutic application of FGFR inhibitors requires knowledge of the molecular profiles of populations that will benefit most from these drugs. Data providing information about the rates and types of FGFR aberrations in a variety of cancer types, as summarized above, will no doubt help to aid design of clinical trials.  The next rate-liming step to understand the clinical implications of such abundant genomic data, however, is the wider assessment of the causative role of these alterations found in cancer; the impact on protein function, including activation state and drug responses, needs to be assessed. In particular, point mutations occur in all regions of the receptor molecules including extracellular, trans-membrane and kinase domains of FGFR1-4, suggesting diverse outcomes and mechanisms [7, 9]. Several pre-clinical studies focusing on some of the frequently observed mutations demonstrated their oncogenic potential. For example, FGFR3 extracellular S249C substitution that occurs in more than 70% of urothelial tumors harboring mutations has been shown to enhance receptor phosphorylation, downstream signaling, saturation density in urothelial cells and to induce transformation of mouse fibroblasts [21]. Furthermore, viability and proliferation of some cancer cell lines with the FGFR3 S249C substitution was compromised by FGFR inhibitors including the FGFR-specific AZD4547 compound [22]. Among FGFR kinase domain (KD) cancer mutations, another FGFR3 activating mutation, K650E, has been most extensively characterized [14, 21, 23]. However, to our knowledge, there is to date no comprehensive study in which different FGFR cancer variants have been directly compared and the impact of mutations assessed quantitatively. Furthermore, it is not clear how different primary or acquired mutations can affect responses to the emerging clinically promising inhibitors, including a number of nonselective and selective TKIs. Because all currently tested TKIs inhibit receptor kinase activity by interfering with the binding of ATP or substrates of the tyrosine kinase domain, mutations occurring within this domain are likely to be particularly relevant in this context. With these aims in mind, here we describe the effect of FGFR KD mutations on kinase activity, using a comprehensive panel, and distinct signatures of drug efficacy for different activating FGFR variants.  Go to: RESULTS Reported mutations in FGFR KD  To obtain a comprehensive insight into mutations affecting the intracellular portion (and in particular KD) of FGFRs, we compiled missense mutation data and performed multiple sequence and structure-based analyses (Figure (Figure1,1, Supplementary Table S1).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Point mutations in the intracellular region of FGFR The intracellular portion (residues 397-806 for FGFR3) comprises the juxtamembrane region, KD and C-terminal regions. The number of observed mutations at each residue within the intracellular portion of FGFR3 was compiled from several cancer databases (COSMIC, TCGA, ICGC and BioMuta) covering all cancer types (Figure (Figure1A,1A, top). Considering the high degree of similarity between FGFR1-4, the same analysis was also performed for all FGFRs and displayed using amino acid numbering for FGFR3 (Figure (Figure1A,1A, bottom). Two frequently mutated positions (â€œhotspotsâ€�) were identified in FGFR3 KD in cancer (K650 and G697) and a third (corresponding to N540 in FGFR3) was revealed only when considering all FGFRs (Figure (Figure1A).1A). The most frequent amino acid replacements at the position corresponding to FGFR3 K650 were E and M while others such as N, Q and T were observed less frequently. For the position corresponding to FGFR3 N540, the most frequent mutation was to K compared to S, D or H. The frequent replacement G697C was reported only for FGFR3 (Figure (Figure1A1A).  It has been previously highlighted that a number of cancer mutations, in particular in FGFR2 and FGFR3, have also been described in various developmental syndromes such as bone dysplasia [4]. Positions mutated in FGFR3 in this type of dysplasia (Figure (Figure1B1B top) included not only one of the hotspots observed in FGFR3 in cancer (K650) (Figure (Figure1A1A top) but also the N540 hotspot position (Figure (Figure1A1A bottom). N540 FGFR3 mutations in bone dysplasia reflect the overall picture of FGFR1-4 mutations in cancer with the replacement N540K being the most frequently observed [24](Figure ](Figure1B1B top). A distinct pattern of cancer mutations in FGFR1-4 can reflect differences in cancer types and their etiology, with FGFR3 mutations being most prevalent in a single cancer type (i.e bladder cancer) [7â€“9].  Comparison of positions mutated in bone dysplasia in all FGFRs with those reported for FGFR3 in cancer (Figure (Figure1B,1B, bottom) highlighted common residues including I538, N540, K650 and R669. With respect to the secondary structure (Figure (Figure1C),1C), I538 and N540 are in the Î±C-Î²4 linker, K650 in the activation (A)-loop and R669 in Î±EF-Î²12 linker. The hot spot position G697 has not been observed in bone dysplasia in any of FGFRs and is present within the Î±F- Î±G linker.  A number of crystal structures of FGFR KD in non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms have been reported [25]. The 3D-structures highlighted the features that undergo substantial changes and play a key role in the activation process; of particular importance is the A-loop and so called â€œmolecular brakeâ€� (Figure (Figure1D,1D, Supplementary Figure S1). When positions of FGFR3 cancer mutations are highlighted in the FGFR KD structure, one hot spot (K650) and 9 other residues are present within the A-loop while R669 is in its vicinity. Residues N540 and I538 are part of the molecular brake.  In a broader context, linking genetic data with the functional outcome remains a challenge and the accuracy is such that most predictions should be seen as complementary to - rather than a replacement for - experimental evaluation [26, 27]. In addition to ranking based on observed mutation frequencies, there are a number of bioinformatics tools that can assess the possible impacts of a mutation (Supplementary Table S1A, Supplementary Figure S2). Many algorithms assume that mutations affecting protein function occur at evolutionarily conserved sites and the meta-predictor CONsensus DELeteriousness score (Condel) combines several of these [28]. More sophisticated predictors make use of available protein structures (such as SAAP, that predicts outcomes using multiple features, or 3D-clustering). Some structure-based tools allow prediction of the energetic impacts of mutations; we used FOLDX [29] to predict changes in stability for all possible FGFR3 KD mutations and ranked them. Stability differences between active and inactive KD can predict mutations expected to shift equilibrium from inactive to active conformations.  We used these tools for analysis of all reported intracellular FGFR3 cancer mutations and also included some common mutations found in other FGFRs or in bone dysplasia. Based on this, we constructed a representative panel for experimental evaluation that covers different structural elements of the KD, frequencies, cancer types and different prediction outcomes (Table (Table1).1). The panel includes about 47% of all intracellular residues reported to be mutated in FGFR3 in cancer.  Table 1 Table 1 Panel of FGFR3 variants selected for experimental studies Kinase activity of FGFR3 KD variants  The number of cancer mutations in FGFR KDs that have been comprehensively assessed for their functional impact is limited, with the most emphasis being on replacements at positions corresponding to FGFR3 K650 and mutation corresponding to FGFR3 N540K [14, 21, 23, 30, 31]. Some comparisons of mutations found in the context of bone dysplasia have also been reported [32â€“34]. However, very few studies compared a panel of cancer mutations or directly and quantitatively measured kinase activity; no such studies have been applied to FGFR3 KD.  Isolated FGFR KDs undergo auto-phosphorylation on several tyrosine residues and this property correlates well with the kinase activity towards natural and synthetic substrates. We used purified proteins of 26 FGFR3 KD variants to directly compare the impact of different mutations on FGFR3 KD auto-phosphorylation (Figure (Figure2A).2A). The most frequent mutations at the hotspot positions, K650E and N540K, resulted in a large increase (up to 45-fold) in auto-phosphorylation. Interestingly, at both positions, the mutations observed less frequently, K650N and N540S, were also less activating. However, surprisingly, the most activating mutation in this assay was a non-hotspot mutation R669G. Another replacement at this position, R669Q, also resulted in an increase of auto-phosphorylation. The least activating among variants that increased FGFR3 KD auto-phosphorylation more than 7-fold was the I538V mutation. Results from further analysis of these activating variants in a substrate phosphorylation assay (Figure (Figure2B,2B, top panel) were generally consistent with the auto-phosphorylation data (Figure (Figure2A2A).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Kinase activity of selected FGFR3 variants harboring point mutations Several other mutations, including V555M, D641G and D641N resulted in an increase of auto-phosphorylation up to 7-fold (Figure (Figure2A)2A) and a similar increase in substrate phosphorylation (Figure (Figure2B,2B, middle panel). The V555M mutation, unlike other mutations in this panel, is an acquired resistance mutation to an FGFR inhibitor (AZ12908010) where the gatekeeper residue, V555, is replaced by a larger side-chain residue [22]. Gatekeeper mutations have been described in many kinases and several studies have shown an associated increase in kinase activity [35â€“37].  Twelve out of 26 analyzed mutations had very little or no effect on FGFR3 KD activity (Figure (Figure2A2A and and2B,2B, bottom panel). The number of observations in cancer for most of these mutations is low with the exception of G697C that represents one of the hotspots (Figure (Figure1A1A).  Two mutations, D617G and G637W, completely abolished kinase activity (Figure (Figure2A2A and and2B,2B, bottom panel). Both residues are strongly conserved among protein kinases and some of the replacements of these residues in various kinases have been tested and shown to result in inactivation [38, 39]. D617 is the key catalytic residue and part of the HRD motif in the C-loop, while G637 resides in the A-loop as a part of the DFG motif. The DFG motif is surprisingly frequently mutated in the cancer kinome [38]. However, a G to W replacement has not been observed and tested previously and, as shown in Figure Figure2B2B (bottom panel), also results in kinase inactivation. In general, the importance of these inactivating mutations for cancer development remains unclear and specifically for FGFRs it could be linked to their suggested, context-dependent tumour protective functions [40].  From these direct measurements of kinase activity it seems that a considerable number of mutations reported so far result in kinase activation to some degree and that replacements that cause activation are not limited to hotspot positions (Figures (Figures2A2A and and2B).2B). However, the comparison of a highly activating K650E and phosphorylated WT FGFR3 KD suggests that even these mutations do not fully convert mutated molecules to their active conformations (Figure (Figure2C2C).  It could be expected that some mutations that map to the KD do not affect kinase activity directly as measured under conditions in vitro. In particular, the hotspot G697C mutation which does not have an effect in such assays (Figure (Figure2A2A and and2B,2B, bottom panel) could impact on FGFR3 function in a way that can only be detected in a cellular setting. To test this possibility, a stably transfected FGFR3 G697C NIH3T3 cell line was compared with cell lines expressing two other hotspot variants, K650E and N540K, and the WT FGFR3 cell line (Figure (Figure3).3). In contrast to cell lines expressing FGFR3 K650E and N540K mutations, FGFR3 G697C NIH3T3 cell line did not show a transformed phenotype (Figure (Figure3A)3A) or anchorage independent growth (Figure (Figure3B);3B); there was no detectable increase in downstream phosphorylation events and levels of phospho-FGFR were comparable to the WT (Figure (Figure3C3C).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Analysis of G697C substitution in a cellular setting Analysis of the FGFR3 R669G NIH3T3 cell line has shown that despite low expression levels, downstream signaling appeared to be enhanced as well as FGFR3 phosphorylation (Figure (Figure4A4A).  Figure 4 Figure 4 Impact of R669G substitution on function of FGFR3 in a cellular setting and on FGFR KD structure Comparison of our experimental data (Figure (Figure2)2) with the assessments obtained using bioinformatics tools (Supplementary Table S1B and S1C) suggests that considering multiple methods together can provide insight into the influences of many panel mutations. Condel predicts three pathogenic mutations (E466K, D617G and G637W) that either reduce protein production or completely inactivate the kinase. Stabilization of active kinase is indicated by FOLDX with good specificity, but low sensitivity. However, most highly activating or moderately activating mutations have supporting evidence from either FOLDX or clustering (Supplementary Table S1B, Supplementary Figure S2). In particular, although not a hotspot, R669 is within an identified cluster of observed A-loop cancer mutations.  Activation mechanism of FGFR3 R669G mutation  The residue corresponding to R669 in FGFR3 is conserved and also mutated in all other FGFRs in cancer as well as in FGFR2 in bone dysplasia (Supplementary Table S1). To assess the mechanism that underpins activation, we first analyzed the R to G replacement in the context of FGFR1 KD that is more amenable to crystallography compared to FGFR3 KD. As shown in Figure Figure4B,4B, R675G FGFR1 KD variant also has higher activity compared to the WT. X-ray data collection and refinement statistics for the R675G FGFR1 KD 3D structure are summarized in Supplementary Table S2.  Comparison of this new FGFR1 R675G KD structure (Figure (Figure4C,4C, top) with inactive (apo) FGFR1 KD (PDB: 4UWY) and active, FGFR1-3P (pdb 3GQI) (Figure (Figure4C,4C, bottom) structures shows that FGFR1 R675G KD differs from the inactive form and adopts a fold with great similarity to the active KD. Notably, in the inactive FGFR1 KD there is direct hydrogen bonding between R675 and H650 from the A-loop; in addition, R675 is found to share a tight van der Waals interaction with active site tyrosine Y653 and H650 (Figure (Figure4C,4C, bottom left inset). These interactions are disturbed and broken in R675G mutant (Figure (Figure4C,4C, top inset), thus favoring the A-loop to adopt an open conformation as found in the active FGFR1-3P (Figure (Figure4C,4C, bottom right inset). In turn, this open conformation of the A-loop leads to several rearrangements of various control elements in the KD â€“ including ordering of spine residues, dissociation in the molecular brake interacting residues, repositioning of the Î±C-helix and movement of the N-lobe toward the C-lobe.  To gain further insight into the activation mechanism of the R669G mutation in FGFR3, we performed NMR studies in which we compared the backbone amide chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) associated with the R669G mutation with those of the WT FGFR3 KD. Our results show that in addition to localized differences around the mutation, there are other differences in distant elements, consistent with a broader conformational change (Supplementary Figure S3). Of particular note are the significant CSPs in the Î±C-Î²4 loop and at the C-terminal end of the Î±C-helix, which likely report on the release of the molecular brake by the R669G mutation. The CSPs in helix Î±G and in the Î±F-Î±G linker also suggest altered interactions with the Î±EF helix and the activation loop, consistent with promotion of an active conformation.  Previous structural studies of FGFR2 KD highlighted a long-range allosteric communication linking the kinase hinge, the Î±C-helix and the A-loop [41]. It was also illustrated that some A-loop mutations (such as FGFR3 K650E), by forcing an active conformation of the loop, can change via this allosteric network the position of the Î±C-helix and also dissociate the molecular brake [23, 41]. We suggest a similar allosteric mechanism for FGFR1 R675G and corresponding FGFR3 R669G mutation that is in this case triggered by the loss of inhibitory interactions in the vicinity of the A-loop that involve the R675/669 residue.  Structural insights into drug binding  Several recent structural studies revealed binding pockets of some selective (BGJ-398 and AZD4547) and non-selective (TKI258 and AP24534) FGFR inhibitors in complexes with FGFR1 KD [37, 42, 43]. For the FGFR-selective inhibitor JNJ42756493 there is much less reported information despite its promise for clinical use [44]. To help rationalize functional differences between these compounds we generated the structure of FGFR1 in complex with JNJ42756493 by soaking the compound into preformed crystals of FGFR1 KD in which there are two molecules of FGFR1 in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The two monomers are highly similar, exhibiting rmsd values of 0.39 Ã… over 280 Ã… and 0.09 Ã… over 39 Ã… within 6 Ã… of the JNJ42756493 binding site. Further discussion will therefore refer to the structure of monomer A. The overall structure of FGFR1 KD bound to JNJ42756493 is shown in Figure Figure5A5A.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Structural insights into JNJ42756493 binding to FGFR1 KD JNJ42756493 occupies the ATP-binding cleft of FGFR1 largely as expected on the basis of previous complexes between FGFR1 and other type-I inhibitors (e. g. BJG-398, AZD4547, PD173074 and TKI258) and where the activation loop clearly exhibits a DFG-in conformation. The quinoxaline core of JNJ42756493 is observed to form a single hydrogen bond to the hinge region via the main chain amide of A564 while the dimethoxyphenyl ring is orientated perpendicular to the quinoxaline core and occupies the hydrophobic pocket located behind the gatekeeper residue (V561). One of the methoxy oxygen atoms is involved in a hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogen atom of the DFG aspartate (D641). The methyl pyrazole solubilizing group extends away from the hinge region towards the solvent channel and does not make any specific interactions with the protein. A structural comparison of various drug compounds (JNJ42756493, BGJ-398, AZD4547, TKI258 and AP24534; Supplementary Figure S4) bound to FGFR1 KD clearly indicates that a unique feature of JNJ42756493 is the amide side chain which extends into the region of the binding site normally occupied by the a-phosphate of ATP where it forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain of D641. In addition the terminal isopropyl group of this side chain also makes good van der Waals interactions with the protein in a shallow pocket formed by the side chains of N628, L630, A640 and D641 that has previously been referred to as the â€œpitâ€� region [45]. Interestingly this indentation in FGFR1 has previously been found to be occupied by a methyl isoxazole moiety in a series of compounds containing a pyrazole core (PDB numbers: 4F64, 4F65, 4NK9, 4NKA and 4NKS). The side chain modification to JNJ42756493 therefore likely makes a significant contribution to its overall binding strength and specificity. Considering that JNJ42756493, BGJ-398, AZD4547, TKI258 and AP24534 are all in clinical trials, structural comparison of their binding to FGFR KD (Supplementary Figure S4) will contribute to understanding their clinical differences.  Changes in drug efficacy due to activating mutations  It is well established that some acquired mutations in protein kinases greatly reduce drug binding; the best-illustrated examples are gatekeeper mutations also described in FGFR3 (V555M) [22, 37]. The question of how primary mutations in FGFR KDs, in particular activating mutations, affect drug efficacy has not been addressed directly although studies of FGFR2 resistance mutations to TKI258 using BaF3 cells suggested this possibility [46]. However, with a number of FGFR inhibitors now in clinical trials it is important to establish accurately their comparative efficacies towards different FGFR variants.  We performed measurements of Ki for AZD4547, BGJ-398, TKI258, JNJ42756493 and AP24534 using purified FGFR3 KD WT and variants R669G, K650E, N540S, N540K, V555M and I538V (Figure (Figure6,6, Supplementary Table S3). Ki values for the WT FGFR3 KD show the first direct comparison of these compounds (Figure (Figure6A);6A); several previous studies focused on a single drug [18, 19, 47]. JNJ42756493 is the most effective (Ki about 2 nM), closely followed by AZD4547 (Ki about 4.5 nM) while another FGFR-specific inhibitor BGJ-398 has a Ki value similar to pan-kinase inhibitors TKI258 and AP24534 (within the range 65-95 nM) (Figure (Figure6A,6A, Supplementary Table S3). Mutations selected for this study include the gatekeeper (V555M) and several other activating mutations that are in the vicinity of the ATP binding pocket (N540S, N540K and I538V); R669G and K650E mutations are further away â€“ however, they could have an allosteric effect (Figure (Figure6B6B).  Figure 6 Figure 6 Inhibitor efficacy for a subset of FGFR3 variants measured in vitro and in cells The impact of each mutation on drug binding is expressed as a fold-difference in Ki compared to the FGFR3 KD WT (Figure (Figure6C).6C). Highly activating R669G and, in particular, hotspot mutation K650E had moderate effects on the efficacy of all inhibitors; all changes for K650E were within 4â€“fold (Figure (Figure6C,6C, Supplementary Table S3). In contrast, mutations at the hotspot position N540 had a more pronounced effect (up to 23-fold) and most affected the compounds with low Ki values, with the N540K substitution affecting AZD4547 more and N540S affecting JNJ42756493 more. As expected, the gatekeeper V555M mutation, conferring resistance to AZ12908010 (similar to AZD4547), had an impact on the efficacy of AZD4547 (about 20-fold). The change in efficacy of JNJ42756493 due to V555M mutation was even greater (about 200-fold) representing the biggest change observed in this panel. Interestingly, as we reported previously [37], the affinity of TKI258 for V555M was higher compared to the WT. Residue I538 is in contact with N540 in the 3D structure [41] and the mutation I538V had substantial effect (up to 40-fold) on all inhibitors.  We further compared the effect of the two most potent FGFR-specific inhibitors AZD4547 and JNJ42756493 on hotspot mutations K650E and N540K in NIH3T3 cell lines. As previously reported [37] and shown in Supplementary Figure S5 NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with the â€œemptyâ€� expression vector are only marginally affected by FGFR inhibitors. An NIH3T3 cell line expressing FGFR3TACC3-fusion protein was used for comparison with the K650E and N540K NIH3T3 cell lines because the FGFR3 KD in this fusion has the WT sequence and, furthermore, this cell line has similarly transformed phenotype (Figure (Figure6D).6D). For the WT KD, AZD4547 and JNJ42756493 cellular IC50s reflect the in vitro differences of about 2-3 fold (Figure (Figure6D,6D, left and Supplementary Table S3). The K650E and N540K variants reduce efficacy of both compounds with the larger impact by the N540K mutation also showing a considerable difference between AZD4547 and JNJ42756493 for this mutant (Figure (Figure6D,6D, middle and right).  Some of the differences between the effects of tested inhibitors on activating FGFR variants (Figure (Figure6)6) are consistent with observations from structural studies. Based on the crystal structure of FGFR1 KD V561M, the interactions of the inhibitors within the ATP-binding pocket, and their chemical structures (Supplementary Figure S1), it is expected that the efficacy of the JNJ42756493 towards FGFR3 V555M would be particularly affected. Contributing factors include the higher rigidity of this compound, compared with AZD4547 and BGJ-398, and the nature of occupancy of the ATP-binding pocket resulting in higher affinity (Figure (Figure5,5, Supplementary Figure S1). In general, 3D structures alone are not sufficient to fully understand the mode and strength of drug binding [48] highlighting the importance of direct measurements performed here.  Go to: DISCUSSION Many clinically relevant cancer mutations were identified based on recurrence rates. However, this strategy cannot be readily applied to alterations that occur in a minority of tumors or to situations where different, rare mutations create the same neoplastic phenotype via different mechanisms. In fact, some of these mutations are of functional significance and likely constitute drivers, therapeutic targets or mechanisms of therapy resistance [49]. Here we have applied a direct comparative analysis of FGFR KD variants that represent the diversity of all mutations found in cancer and characterized their impact on kinase activity; for a subset of activating mutations we have also established their responsiveness to several drugs of particular clinical interest.  Our data reinforce the importance of frequently observed mutations at positions corresponding to FGFR3 N540 and K650 that occur in different FGFRs and in a range of cancer types as well as in bone dysplasia (Figures (Figures11â€“3, Supplementary Table S1) [7, 9, 24]. In particular, replacements N to K and K to E at the respective positions are highly activating in vitro and transforming in NIH3T3 cells (Figures (Figures22 and and3).3). In contrast, we have not been able to provide supporting evidence for an activating nature of FGFR3 mutation G697C (Figure (Figure22 and and3).3). A relatively high number of observations of this mutation highlight FGFR3 G697C as another hotspot mutation (Figure (Figure1).1). However, all observations of FGFR3 G697C were reported in a single study of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) [50]. It is possible that the activating potential of this mutation could be context dependent and involve interaction with another component(s) present in this type of epithelial cells. Interestingly, another study examining a comparable number of OSCC cases from a different population failed to detect FGFR3 G697C, arguing that this mutation is unlikely to be common even in this cancer type [51]. It is also conceivable that the occurrence of this mutation in a specific population could be unrelated to FGFR activation and involvement in OSCC. Further studies, focusing on FGFR3 G697C in epithelial cells rather than on comparative analysis shown here, would be needed to confirm this possibility.  A number of non-hotspot mutations have an impact on kinase activity, mainly resulting in moderate activation (Figure (Figure2).2). At least some of these mutations are likely to have clinical relevance and they include a gatekeeper mutation (FGFR3 V555M) and a mutation (corresponding to FGFR3 I538V) also identified in a developmental disorder (hypochondroplasia) (Supplementary Table S1). The importance of mutations resulting in a lower degree of activation has been illustrated in developmental disorders, linking these mutations to less severe syndromes [52]; it is also possible that they could contribute to generation or progression of tumors or may be selected for after the selective pressure of anti-FGFR treatments. Moreover, we have established that an infrequent cancer mutation corresponding to R669G in FGFR3, also found in bone dysplasia, greatly enhances kinase activity of FGFR (Figures (Figures11 and and2).2). One observation that could be related to its low reported frequency in cancer is the finding of low expression levels of this mutation in transfected mammalian cells (compared to FGFR3 N540K, K650E or WT) (Figure (Figure4)4) that might compromise its impact or could require additional changes in cancer cells to increase its stability or expression. Nevertheless, structural studies of this mutation in the context of FGFR1 KD (R675G) are fully consistent with its activating potential. Furthermore, we here reveal a new feature of FGFR KD that stabilizes the inactive conformation which, when disrupted by mutations, can result in activation â€“ namely, a set of interactions in the vicinity of the A-loop that involve R669/675 (Figure (Figure4).4). Our new structural insights also consolidate observations resulting from structural studies of several other activating variants including FGFR2 N549H/T mutations in the molecular brake, FGFR2 K659N and FGFR3 K650E in the A-loop and FGFR1 V651M gatekeeper mutation affecting the regulatory spine [23, 37, 41]. Although R669/675 and these other mutations affect different regions in FGFR KD, the local structural changes trigger alterations in FGFR KD allosteric networks resulting in a shift towards conformations resembling an active form of phosphorylated kinase.  Combined with several recent structural studies of inhibitory compounds bound to FGFR KDs [37, 42, 43], our crystal structure of the JNJ42756493/FGFR1 KD complex provides a detailed picture of common features and key differences in the extent and nature of their binding interactions (Figure (Figure5,5, Supplementary Figure S4). While these structures provide an important basis for understanding and improving the function of FGFR inhibitors, there are also limitations, in particular understanding the consequence of specific FGFR mutations requires direct experimental assessment. Indeed, our direct measurements of Ki values in vitro and evaluation of effects in cells show a complex picture where different mutations, including replacements of the same residue, can have very profound effects on the efficacy of some inhibitors but not on others (Figures (Figures6C6C and and6D).6D). In the case of FGFR3 acquired gatekeeper mutation (V555M), this is illustrated by about 200-fold reduction in efficacy for JNJ42756493 and an increase in efficacy for TKI258 (Figure (Figure6C).6C). Considering a good correlation between in vitro and in vivo effects of FGFR inhibitors in our previous study [37], these data are likely to be relevant for a cellular setting. Consistent with the in vitro data, we have observed loss of efficacy for PD173074 with the effect of TKI258 retained following introduction of FGFR3 V555M mutation in a cell line originally responding to both drugs [37]. Because JNJ42756493 is also effective towards FGFR4 [20], these findings could be important when considering the use of JNJ42756493 as a first-line treatment; primary, activating mutations corresponding to gatekeeper replacements have been reported in rhabdomyosarcoma (FGFR4 V550L and V550E) and in breast cancer (FGFR4 V550M) [16, 38]. Another example that could inform the use of FGFR-selective inhibitors in the clinic is the effect of the hotspot N540K mutation on JNJ42756493 and AZD4547 that shows a larger impact on AZD4547 both in vitro and in cells (Figures (Figures6C6C and and6D).6D). Differential responses (response to TKI258 and AP24534 compared with reduced sensitivity to PD173074) due to the mutation corresponding to N540K, introduced in FGFR2 in the context of the JHUEM-2 cancer cell line, have been previously observed [46].  For aberrations where the FGFR KD retains the WT sequence (such as overexpression and a number of fusion proteins) the efficacy of both JNJ42756493 and AZD4547 could be expected to be high, as we illustrate here using the WT protein in vitro and FGFR3TACC3-fusion in cells (Figures (Figures6A6A and and6D).6D). More broadly, previous assessments of efficacy of several FGFR-specific inhibitors in separate studies have shown a good response in cancers with gene amplification of the FGFR WT or fusion proteins; these studies were based on available panels of cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts [22, 42, 53â€“55]. However, there are only a few cancer cell lines harboring point mutations in the FGFR KD with just two mutations being represented, FGFR3 K650E and FGFR2 N550K. Due to various changes that co-occur with FGFR mutations in each of these cell lines, it was difficult to assess and compare their responses and obtain conclusive data. Therefore, our studies of drug efficacy performed in vitro and in stable cell lines, complement and expand these previous assessments and reveal differential, drug-specific impacts of different FGFR KD mutations.\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) regulate a variety of fundamental cellular processes. CDK10 stands out as one of the last orphan CDKs for which no activating cyclin has been identified and no kinase activity revealed. Previous work has shown that CDK10 silencing increases ETS2 (v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 2)-driven activation of the MAPK pathway, which confers tamoxifen resistance to breast cancer cells. The precise mechanisms by which CDK10 modulates ETS2 activity, and more generally the functions of CDK10, remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that CDK10 is a cyclin-dependent kinase by identifying cyclin M as an activating cyclin. Cyclin M, an orphan cyclin, is the product of FAM58A, whose mutations cause STAR syndrome, a human developmental anomaly whose features include toe syndactyly, telecanthus, and anogenital and renal malformations. We show that STAR syndrome-associated cyclin M mutants are unable to interact with CDK10. Cyclin M silencing phenocopies CDK10 silencing in increasing c-Raf and in conferring tamoxifen resistance to breast cancer cells. CDK10/cyclin M phosphorylates ETS2 in vitro, and in cells it positively controls ETS2 degradation by the proteasome. ETS2 protein levels are increased in cells derived from a STAR patient, and this increase is attributable to decreased cyclin M levels. Altogether, our results reveal an additional regulatory mechanism for ETS2, which plays key roles in cancer and development. They also shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying STAR syndrome.Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a pivotal role in the control of a number of fundamental cellular processes (1). The human genome contains 21 genes encoding proteins that can be considered as members of the CDK family owing to their sequence similarity with bona fide CDKs, those known to be activated by cyclins (2). Although discovered almost 20 y ago (3, 4), CDK10 remains one of the two CDKs without an identified cyclin partner. This knowledge gap has largely impeded the exploration of its biological functions. CDK10 can act as a positive cell cycle regulator in some cells (5, 6) or as a tumor suppressor in others (7, 8). CDK10 interacts with the ETS2 (v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 2) transcription factor and inhibits its transcriptional activity through an unknown mechanism (9). CDK10 knockdown derepresses ETS2, which increases the expression of the c-Raf protein kinase, activates the MAPK pathway, and induces resistance of MCF7 cells to tamoxifen (6).Here, we deorphanize CDK10 by identifying cyclin M, the product of FAM58A, as a binding partner. Mutations in this gene that predict absence or truncation of cyclin M are associated with STAR syndrome, whose features include toe syndactyly, telecanthus, and anogenital and renal malformations in heterozygous females (10). However, both the functions of cyclin M and the pathogenesis of STAR syndrome remain unknown. We show that a recombinant CDK10/cyclin M heterodimer is an active protein kinase that phosphorylates ETS2 in vitro. Cyclin M silencing phenocopies CDK10 silencing in increasing c-Raf and phospho-ERK expression levels and in inducing tamoxifen resistance in estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer cells. We show that CDK10/cyclin M positively controls ETS2 degradation by the proteasome, through the phosphorylation of two neighboring serines. Finally, we detect an increased ETS2 expression level in cells derived from a STAR patient, and we demonstrate that it is attributable to the decreased cyclin M expression level observed in these cells.Previous SectionNext SectionResultsA yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen unveiled an interaction signal between CDK10 and a mouse protein whose C-terminal half presents a strong sequence homology with the human FAM58A gene product [whose proposed name is cyclin M (11)]. We thus performed Y2H mating assays to determine whether human CDK10 interacts with human cyclin M (Fig. 1 Aâ€“C). The longest CDK10 isoform (P1) expressed as a bait protein produced a strong interaction phenotype with full-length cyclin M (expressed as a prey protein) but no detectable phenotype with cyclin D1, p21 (CIP1), and Cdi1 (KAP), which are known binding partners of other CDKs (Fig. 1B). CDK1 and CDK3 also produced Y2H signals with cyclin M, albeit notably weaker than that observed with CDK10 (Fig. 1B). An interaction phenotype was also observed between full-length cyclin M and CDK10 proteins expressed as bait and prey, respectively (Fig. S1A). We then tested different isoforms of CDK10 and cyclin M originating from alternative gene splicing, and two truncated cyclin M proteins corresponding to the hypothetical products of two mutated FAM58A genes found in STAR syndrome patients (10). None of these shorter isoforms produced interaction phenotypes (Fig. 1 A and C and Fig. S1A).Fig. 1.In a new window Download PPTFig. 1.CDK10 and cyclin M form an interaction complex.

The red box indicates a differing amino acid sequence compared with CDK10 P1. (B) Y2H assay between a set of CDK proteins expressed as baits (in fusion to the LexA DNA binding domain) and CDK interacting proteins expressed as preys (in fusion to the B42 transcriptional activator). pEG202 and pJG4-5 are the empty bait and prey plasmids expressing LexA and B42, respectively. lacZ was used as a reporter gene, and blue yeast are indicative of a Y2H interaction phenotype. (C) Y2H assay between the different CDK10 and cyclin M isoforms. The amino-terminal region of ETS2, known to interact with CDK10 (9), was also assayed. (D) Western blot analysis of Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) and CycM-V5-6His expression levels in transfected HEK293 cells. (E) Western blot analysis of Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) immunoprecipitates obtained using the anti-Myc antibody. â€œInputsâ€� correspond to 10 Î¼g total lysates obtained from HEK293 cells coexpressing Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) and CycM-V5-6His. (F) Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitates obtained using the anti-CDK10 antibody or a control goat antibody, from human breast cancer MCF7 cells. â€œInputâ€� corresponds to 30 Î¼g MCF7 total cell lysates. The lower band of the doublet observed on the upper panel comigrates with the exogenously expressed untagged CDK10 and thus corresponds to endogenous CDK10. The upper band of the doublet corresponds to a nonspecific signal, as demonstrated by it insensitivity to either overexpression of CDK10 (as seen on the left lane) or silencing of CDK10 (Fig. S2B). Another experiment with a longer gel migration is shown in Fig. S1D.Next we examined the ability of CDK10 and cyclin M to interact when expressed in human cells (Fig. 1 D and E). We tested wild-type CDK10 (wt) and a kinase dead (kd) mutant bearing a D181A amino acid substitution that abolishes ATP binding (12). We expressed cyclin M-V5-6His and/or Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) in a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293). The expression level of cyclin M-V5-6His was significantly increased upon coexpression with Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) and, to a lesser extent, that of Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) was increased upon coexpression with cyclin M-V5-6His (Fig. 1D). We then immunoprecipitated Myc-CDK10 proteins and detected the presence of cyclin M in the CDK10 (wt) and (kd) immunoprecipitates only when these proteins were coexpressed pair-wise (Fig. 1E). We confirmed these observations by detecting the presence of Myc-CDK10 in cyclin M-V5-6His immunoprecipitates (Fig. S1B). These experiments confirmed the lack of robust interaction between the CDK10.P2 isoform and cyclin M (Fig. S1C). To detect the interaction between endogenous proteins, we performed immunoprecipitations on nontransfected MCF7 cells derived from a human breast cancer. CDK10 and cyclin M antibodies detected their cognate endogenous proteins by Western blotting. We readily detected cyclin M in immunoprecipitates obtained with the CDK10 antibody but not with a control antibody (Fig. 1F). These results confirm the physical interaction between CDK10 and cyclin M in human cells.To unveil a hypothesized CDK10/cyclin M protein kinase activity, we produced GST-CDK10 and StrepII-cyclin M fusion proteins in insect cells, either individually or in combination. We observed that GST-CDK10 and StrepII-cyclin M copurified, thus confirming their interaction in yet another cellular model (Fig. 2A). We then performed in vitro kinase assays with purified proteins, using histone H1 as a generic substrate. Histone H1 phosphorylation was detected only from lysates of cells coexpressing GST-CDK10 and StrepII-cyclin M. No phosphorylation was detected when GST-CDK10 or StrepII-cyclin M were expressed alone, or when StrepII-cyclin M was coexpressed with GST-CDK10(kd) (Fig. 2A). Next we investigated whether ETS2, which is known to interact with CDK10 (9) (Fig. 1C), is a phosphorylation substrate of CDK10/cyclin M. We detected strong phosphorylation of ETS2 by the GST-CDK10/StrepII-cyclin M purified heterodimer, whereas no phosphorylation was detected using GST-CDK10 alone or GST-CDK10(kd)/StrepII-cyclin M heterodimer (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2.In a new window Download PPTFig. 2.CDK10 is a cyclin M-dependent protein kinase. (A) In vitro protein kinase assay on histone H1. Lysates from insect cells expressing different proteins were purified on a glutathione Sepharose matrix to capture GST-CDK10(wt or kd) fusion proteins alone, or in complex with STR-CycM fusion protein. Purified protein expression levels were analyzed by Western blots (Top and Upper Middle). The kinase activity was determined by autoradiography of histone H1, whose added amounts were visualized by Coomassie staining (Lower Middle and Bottom). (B) Same as in A, using purified recombinant 6His-ETS2 as a substrate.CDK10 silencing has been shown to increase ETS2-driven c-RAF transcription and to activate the MAPK pathway (6). We investigated whether cyclin M is also involved in this regulatory pathway. To aim at a highly specific silencing, we used siRNA pools (mix of four different siRNAs) at low final concentration (10 nM). Both CDK10 and cyclin M siRNA pools silenced the expression of their cognate targets (Fig. 3 A and C and Fig. S2) and, interestingly, the cyclin M siRNA pool also caused a marked decrease in CDK10 protein level (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2B). These results, and those shown in Fig. 1D, suggest that cyclin M binding stabilizes CDK10. Cyclin M silencing induced an increase in c-Raf protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 3 B and C) and in phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 protein levels (Fig. S3B), similarly to CDK10 silencing. As expected from these effects (6), CDK10 and cyclin M silencing both decreased the sensitivity of ER+ MCF7 cells to tamoxifen, to a similar extent. The combined silencing of both genes did not result in a higher resistance to the drug (Fig. S3C). Altogether, these observations demonstrate a functional interaction between cyclin M and CDK10, which negatively controls ETS2.Fig. 3.In a new window Download PPTFig. 3.Cyclin M silencing up-regulates c-Raf expression.

ETS2 is a short-lived protein degraded by the proteasome (13). A straightforward hypothesis is that CDK10/cyclin M positively controls ETS2 degradation. We thus examined the impact of CDK10 or cyclin M silencing on ETS2 expression levels. The silencing of CDK10 and that of cyclin M caused an increase in the expression levels of an exogenously expressed Flag-ETS2 protein (Fig. S4A), as well as of the endogenous ETS2 protein (Fig. 4A). This increase is not attributable to increased ETS2 mRNA levels, which marginally fluctuated in response to CDK10 or cyclin M silencing (Fig. S4B). We then examined the expression levels of the Flag-tagged ETS2 protein when expressed alone or in combination with Myc-CDK10 or -CDK10(kd), with or without cyclin M-V5-6His. Flag-ETS2 was readily detected when expressed alone or, to a lesser extent, when coexpressed with CDK10(kd). However, its expression level was dramatically decreased when coexpressed with CDK10 alone, or with CDK10 and cyclin M (Fig. 4B). These observations suggest that endogenous cyclin M levels are in excess compared with those of CDK10 in MCF7 cells, and they show that the major decrease in ETS2 levels observed upon CDK10 coexpression involves CDK10 kinase activity. Treatment of cells coexpressing Flag-ETS2, CDK10, and cyclin M with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 largely rescued Flag-ETS2 expression levels (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4.In a new window Download PPTFig. 4.CDK10/cyclin M controls ETS2 stability in human cancer derived cells. (A) Western blot analysis of endogenous ETS2 expression levels in MCF7 cells, in response to siRNA-mediated CDK10 and/or cyclin M silencing. A quantification is shown in Fig. S4B. (B) Western blot analysis of exogenously expressed Flag-ETS2 protein levels in MCF7 cells cotransfected with empty vectors or coexpressing Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd), or Myc-CDK10/CycM-V5-6His. The latter cells were treated for 16 h with the MG132 proteasome inhibitor. Proper expression of CDK10 and cyclin M tagged proteins was verified by Western blot analysis. (C and D) Western blot analysis of expression levels of exogenously expressed Flag-ETS2 wild-type or mutant proteins in MCF7 cells, in the absence of (C) or in response to (D) Myc-CDK10/CycM-V5-6His expression. Quantifications are shown in Fig. S4 C and D.A mass spectrometry analysis of recombinant ETS2 phosphorylated by CDK10/cyclin M in vitro revealed the existence of multiple phosphorylated residues, among which are two neighboring phospho-serines (at positions 220 and 225) that may form a phosphodegron (14) (Figs. S5â€“S8). To confirm this finding, we compared the phosphorylation level of recombinant ETS2wt with that of ETS2SASA protein, a mutant bearing alanine substitutions of these two serines. As expected from the existence of multiple phosphorylation sites, we detected a small but reproducible, significant decrease of phosphorylation level of ETS2SASA compared with ETS2wt (Fig. S9), thus confirming that Ser220/Ser225 are phosphorylated by CDK10/cyclin M. To establish a direct link between ETS2 phosphorylation by CDK10/cyclin M and degradation, we examined the expression levels of Flag-ETS2SASA. In the absence of CDK10/cyclin M coexpression, it did not differ significantly from that of Flag-ETS2. This is contrary to that of Flag-ETS2DBM, bearing a deletion of the N-terminal destruction (D-) box that was previously shown to be involved in APC-Cdh1â€“mediated degradation of ETS2 (13) (Fig. 4C). However, contrary to Flag-ETS2 wild type, the expression level of Flag-ETS2SASA remained insensitive to CDK10/cyclin M coexpression (Fig. 4D). Altogether, these results suggest that CDK10/cyclin M directly controls ETS2 degradation through the phosphorylation of these two serines.Finally, we studied a lymphoblastoid cell line derived from a patient with STAR syndrome, bearing FAM58A mutation c.555+1G&amp;gt;A, predicted to result in aberrant splicing (10). In accordance with incomplete skewing of X chromosome inactivation previously found in this patient, we detected a decreased expression level of cyclin M protein in the STAR cell line, compared with a control lymphoblastoid cell line. In line with our preceding observations, we detected an increased expression level of ETS2 protein in the STAR cell line compared with the control (Fig. 5A and Fig. S10A). We then examined by quantitative RT-PCR the mRNA expression levels of the corresponding genes. The STAR cell line showed a decreased expression level of cyclin M mRNA but an expression level of ETS2 mRNA similar to that of the control cell line (Fig. 5B). To demonstrate that the increase in ETS2 protein expression is indeed a result of the decreased cyclin M expression observed in the STAR patient-derived cell line, we expressed cyclin M-V5-6His in this cell line. This expression caused a decrease in ETS2 protein levels (Fig. 5C).Fig. 5.In a new window Download PPTFig. 5.Decreased cyclin M expression in STAR patient-derived cells results in increased ETS2 protein level.

(C) Western blot analysis of ETS2 protein levels in the STAR patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell line transfected with an empty vector or a vector directing the expression of cyclin M-V5-6His. Another Western blot revealing endogenously and exogenously expressed cyclin M levels is shown in Fig. S10B. A quantification of ETS2 protein levels is shown in Fig. S10C.Previous SectionNext SectionDiscussionIn this work, we unveil the interaction between CDK10, the last orphan CDK discovered in the pregenomic era (2), and cyclin M, the only cyclin associated with a human genetic disease so far, and whose functions remain unknown (10). The closest paralogs of CDK10 within the CDK family are the CDK11 proteins, which interact with L-type cyclins (15). Interestingly, the closest paralog of these cyclins within the cyclin family is cyclin M (Fig. S11). The fact that none of the shorter CDK10 isoforms interact robustly with cyclin M suggests that alternative splicing of the CDK10 gene (16, 17) plays an important role in regulating CDK10 functions.The functional relevance of the interaction between CDK10 and cyclin M is supported by different observations. Both proteins seem to enhance each otherâ€™s stability, as judged from their increased expression levels when their partner is exogenously coexpressed (Fig. 1D) and from the much reduced endogenous CDK10 expression level observed in response to cyclin M silencing (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2B). CDK10 is subject to ubiquitin-mediated degradation (18). Our observations suggest that cyclin M protects CDK10 from such degradation and that it is the only cyclin partner of CDK10, at least in MCF7 cells. They also suggest that cyclin M stability is enhanced upon binding to CDK10, independently from its kinase activity, as seen for cyclin C and CDK8 (19). We uncover a cyclin M-dependent CDK10 protein kinase activity in vitro, thus demonstrating that this protein, which was named a CDK on the sole basis of its amino acid sequence, is indeed a genuine cyclin-dependent kinase. Our Y2H assays reveal that truncated cyclin M proteins corresponding to the hypothetical products of two STAR syndrome-associated FAM58A mutations do not produce an interaction phenotype with CDK10. Hence, regardless of whether these mutated mRNAs undergo nonsense-mediated decay (as suggested from the decreased cyclin M mRNA levels in STAR cells, shown in Fig. 5B) or give rise to truncated cyclin M proteins, females affected by the STAR syndrome must exhibit compromised CDK10/cyclin M kinase activity at least in some tissues and during specific developmental stages.We show that ETS2, a known interactor of CDK10, is a phosphorylation substrate of CDK10/cyclin M in vitro and that CDK10/cyclin M kinase activity positively controls ETS2 degradation by the proteasome. This control seems to be exerted through a very fine mechanism, as judged from the sensitivity of ETS2 levels to partially decreased CDK10 and cyclin M levels, achieved in MCF7 cells and observed in STAR cells, respectively. These findings offer a straightforward explanation for the already reported up-regulation of ETS2-driven transcription of c-RAF in response to CDK10 silencing (6). We bring evidence that CDK10/cyclin M directly controls ETS2 degradation through the phosphorylation of two neighboring serines, which may form a noncanonical Î²-TRCP phosphodegron (DSMCPAS) (14). Because none of these two serines precede a proline, they do not conform to usual CDK phosphorylation sites. However, multiple so-called transcriptional CDKs (CDK7, -8, -9, and -11) (to which CDK10 may belong; Fig. S11) have been shown to phosphorylate a variety of motifs in a nonâ€“proline-directed fashion, especially in the context of molecular docking with the substrate (20). Here, it can be hypothesized that the high-affinity interaction between CDK10 and the Pointed domain of ETS2 (6, 9) (Fig. 1C) would allow docking-mediated phosphorylation of atypical sites. The control of ETS2 degradation involves a number of players, including APC-Cdh1 (13) and the cullin-RING ligase CRL4 (21). The formal identification of the ubiquitin ligase involved in the CDK10/cyclin M pathway and the elucidation of its concerted action with the other ubiquitin ligases to regulate ETS2 degradation will require further studies.Our results present a number of significant biological and medical implications. First, they shed light on the regulation of ETS2, which plays an important role in development (22) and is frequently deregulated in many cancers (23). Second, our results contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms causing tamoxifen resistance associated with reduced CDK10 expression levels, and they suggest that, like CDK10 (6), cyclin M could also be a predictive clinical marker of hormone therapy response of ERÎ±-positive breast cancer patients. Third, our findings offer an interesting hypothesis on the molecular mechanisms underlying STAR syndrome. Ets2 transgenic mice showing a less than twofold overexpression of Ets2 present severe cranial abnormalities (24), and those observed in STAR patients could thus be caused at least in part by increased ETS2 protein levels. Another expected consequence of enhanced ETS2 expression levels would be a decreased risk to develop certain types of cancers and an increased risk to develop others. Studies on various mouse models (including models of Down syndrome, in which three copies of ETS2 exist) have revealed that ETS2 dosage can repress or promote tumor growth and, hence, that ETS2 exerts noncell autonomous functions in cancer (25). Intringuingly, one of the very few STAR patients identified so far has been diagnosed with a nephroblastoma (26). Finally, our findings will facilitate the general exploration of the biological functions of CDK10 and, in particular, its role in the control of cell division. Previous studies have suggested either a positive role in cell cycle control (5, 6) or a tumor-suppressive activity in some cancers (7, 8). The severe growth retardation exhibited by STAR patients strongly suggests that CDK10/cyclin M plays an important role in the control of cell proliferation.Previous SectionNext SectionMaterials and MethodsCloning of CDK10 and cyclin M cDNAs, plasmid constructions, tamoxifen response analysis, quantitative RT-PCR, mass spectrometry experiments, and antibody production are detailed in SI Materials and Methods.Yeast Two-Hybrid Interaction Assays. We performed yeast interaction mating assays as previously described (27).Mammalian Cell Cultures and Transfections. We grew human HEK293 and MCF7 cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Invitrogen), and we grew lymphoblastoid cells in RPMI 1640 GlutaMAX supplemented with 15% (vol/vol) FBS. We transfected HEK293 and MCF7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for plasmids, Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) for siRNAs, and Jetprime (Polyplus) for plasmids/siRNAs combinations according to the manufacturersâ€™ instructions. We transfected lymphoblastoid cells by electroporation (Neon, Invitrogen). For ETS2 stability studies we treated MCF7 cells 32 h after transfection with 10 Î¼M MG132 (Fisher Scientific) for 16 h.Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blot Experiments. We collected cells by scraping in PBS (or centrifugation for lymphoblastoid cells) and lysed them by sonication in a lysis buffer containing 60 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, 15 mM p-nitrophenylphosphate, 25 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (Mops) (pH 7.2), 15 mM EGTA, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM Na vanadate, 1 mM NaF, 1mM phenylphosphate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). We spun the lysates 15 min at 20,000 Ã— g at 4 Â°C, collected the supernatants, and determined the protein content using a Bradford assay. We performed the immunoprecipitation experiments on 500 Î¼g of total proteins, in lysis buffer. We precleared the lysates with 20 Î¼L of protein A or G-agarose beads, incubated 1 h 4 Â°C on a rotating wheel. We added 5 Î¼g of antibody to the supernatants, incubated 1 h 4 Â°C on a rotating wheel, added 20 Î¼L of protein A or G-agarose beads, and incubated 1 h 4 Â°C on a rotating wheel. We collected the beads by centrifugation 30 s at 18,000 Ã— g at 4 Â°C and washed three times in a bead buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mM NaF, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor coktail (Roche). We directly added sample buffer to the washed pellets, heat-denatured the proteins, and ran the samples on 10% Bis-Tris SDS/PAGE. We transferred the proteins onto Hybond nitrocellulose membranes and processed the blots according to standard procedures. For Western blot experiments, we used the following primary antibodies: anti-Myc (Abcam ab9106, 1:2,000), anti-V5 (Invitrogen R960, 1:5,000), anti-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology B-7, 1:500), anti-CDK10 (Covalab pab0847p, 1:500 or Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-19, 1:500), anti-CycM (home-made, dilution 1:500 or Covalab pab0882-P, dilution 1:500), anti-Raf1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-20, 1:1,000), anti-ETS2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-20, 1:1,000), anti-Flag (Sigma F7425, 1:1,000), and anti-actin (Sigma A5060, 1:5,000). We used HRP-coupled anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology SC-2033, dilution 1:2,000), anti-mouse (Bio-Rad 170â€“6516, dilution 1:3,000) or anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad 172â€“1019, 1:5,000) as secondary antibodies. We revealed the blots by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Femto, Thermo Scientific).Production and Purification of Recombinant Proteins.GST-CDK10(kd)/StrepII-CycM. We generated recombinant bacmids in DH10Bac Escherichia coli and baculoviruses in Sf9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac system, as described by the provider (Invitrogen). We infected Sf9 cells with GST-CDK10- (or GST-CDK10kd)-producing viruses, or coinfected the cells with StrepII-CycMâ€“producing viruses, and we collected the cells 72 h after infection. To purify GST-fusion proteins, we spun 250 mL cells and resuspended the pellet in 40 mL lysis buffer (PBS, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, and 0.3 mM Na-vanadate) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). We lysed the cells by sonication, spun the lysate 30 min at 15,000 Ã— g, collected the soluble fraction, and added it to a 1-mL glutathione-Sepharose matrix. We incubated 1 h at 4 Â°C, washed four times with lysis buffer, one time with kinase buffer A (see below), and finally resuspended the beads in 100 Î¼L kinase buffer A containing 10% (vol/vol) glycerol for storage.6His-ETS2. We transformed Origami2 DE3 (Novagen) with the 6His-ETS2 expression vector. We induced expression with 0.2 mM isopropyl-Î²-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 22 Â°C. To purify 6His-ETS2, we spun 50 mL cells and resuspended the pellet in 2 mL lysis buffer (PBS, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, 1 mM DTT, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA (Roche). We lysed the cells at 1.6 bar using a cell disruptor and spun the lysate 10 min at 20,000 Ã— g. We collected the soluble fraction and added it to 200 Î¼L Cobalt beads (Thermo Scientific). After 1 h incubation at 4 Â°C on a rotating wheel, we washed four times with lysis buffer. To elute, we incubated beads 30 min with elution buffer (PBS, 250 mM imidazole, pH 7.6) containing the protease inhibitor mixture, spun 30 s at 10,000 Ã— g, and collected the eluted protein.Protein Kinase Assays. We mixed glutathione-Sepharose beads (harboring GST-CDK10 wt or kd, either monomeric or complexed with StrepII-CycM), 22.7 Î¼M BSA, 15 mM DTT, 100 Î¼M ATP, 5 Î¼Ci ATP[Î³-32P], 7.75 Î¼M histone H1, or 1 Î¼M 6His-ETS2 and added kinase buffer A (25 mM TrisÂ·HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and 3.7 Î¼M heparin, pH 7.5) up to a total volume of 30 Î¼L. We incubated the reactions 30 min at 30 Â°C, added Laemli sample buffer, heat-denatured the samples, and ran 10% Bis-Tris SDS/PAGE. We cut gel slices to detect GST-CDK10 and StrepII-CycM by Western blotting. We stained the gel slices containing the substrate with Coomassie (R-250, Bio-Rad), dried them, and detected the incorporated radioactivity by autoradiography. We identified four unrelated girls with anogenital and renal malformations, dysmorphic facial features, normal intellect and syndactyly of toes. A similar combination of features had been reported previously in a motherâ€“daughter pair1 (Table 1 and Supplementary Note online). These authors noted clinical overlap with Townes-Brocks syndrome but suggested that the phenotype represented a separate autosomal dominant entity (MIM601446). Here we define the cardinal features of this syndrome as a characteristic facial appearance with apparent telecanthus and broad tripartite nasal tip, variable syndactyly of toes 2â€“5, hypoplastic labia, anal atresia and urogenital malformations (Fig. 1aâ€“h). We also observed a variety of other features (Table 1).  Figure 1: Clinical and molecular characterization of STAR syndrome.  Figure 1 : Clinical and molecular characterization of STAR syndrome. (aâ€“f) Facial appearances of cases 1â€“3 (apparent telecanthus, dysplastic ears and thin upper lips; a,c,e), and toe syndactyly 2â€“5, 3â€“5 or 4â€“5 (b,d,f) in these cases illustrate recognizable features of STAR syndrome (specific parental consent has been obtained for publication of these photographs). Anal atresia and hypoplastic labia are not shown.

Log2 ratio represents copy number loss of six probes spanning between 37.9 and 50.7 kb, with one probe positioned within FAM58A. The deletion does not remove parts of other functional genes. (j) Schematic structure of FAM58A and position of the mutations. FAM58A has five coding exons (boxes). The cyclin domain (green) is encoded by exons 2â€“4. The horizontal arrow indicates the deletion extending 5&#x27; in case 1, which includes exons 1 and 2, whereas the horizontal line below exon 5 indicates the deletion found in case 3, which removes exon 5 and some 3&#x27; sequence. The pink horizontal bars above the boxes indicate the amplicons used for qPCR and sequencing (one alternative exon 5 amplicon is not indicated because of space constraints). The mutation 201dupT (case 4) results in an immediate stop codon, and the 555+1G&amp;gt;A and 555-1G&amp;gt;A splice mutations in cases 2, 5 and 6 are predicted to be deleterious because they alter the conserved splice donor and acceptor site of intron 4, respectively.  Full size image (97 KB)  Table 1: Clinical features in STAR syndrome cases  Table 1 - Clinical features in STAR syndrome cases  Full table  On the basis of the phenotypic overlap with Townes-Brocks, Okihiro and Feingold syndromes, we analyzed SALL1 (ref. 2), SALL4 (ref. 3) and MYCN4 but found no mutations in any of these genes (Supplementary Methods online). Next, we carried out genome-wide high-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)5 analysis (Supplementary Methods) of genomic DNA from the most severely affected individual (case 1, with lower lid coloboma, epilepsy and syringomyelia) and identified a heterozygous deletion of 37.9â€“50.7 kb on Xq28, which removed exons 1 and 2 of FAM58A (Fig. 1i,j). Using real-time PCR, we confirmed the deletion in the child and excluded it in her unaffected parents (Supplementary Fig. 1a online, Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 1 online). Through CGH with a customized oligonucleotide array enriched in probes for Xq28, followed by breakpoint cloning, we defined the exact deletion size as 40,068 bp (g.152,514,164_152,554,231del(chromosome X, NCBI Build 36.2); Fig. 1j and Supplementary Figs. 2,3 online). The deletion removes the coding regions of exons 1 and 2 as well as intron 1 (2,774 bp), 492 bp of intron 2, and 36,608 bp of 5&#x27; sequence, including the 5&#x27; UTR and the entire KRT18P48 pseudogene (NCBI gene ID 340598). Paternity was proven using routine methods. We did not find deletions overlapping FAM58A in the available copy number variation (CNV) databases.  Subsequently, we carried out qPCR analysis of the three other affected individuals (cases 2, 3 and 4) and the mother-daughter pair from the literature (cases 5 and 6). In case 3, we detected a de novo heterozygous deletion of 1.1â€“10.3 kb overlapping exon 5 (Supplementary Fig. 1b online). Using Xq28-targeted array CGH and breakpoint cloning, we identified a deletion of 4,249 bp (g.152,504,123_152,508,371del(chromosome X, NCBI Build 36.2); Fig. 1j and Supplementary Figs. 2,3), which removed 1,265 bp of intron 4, all of exon 5, including the 3&#x27; UTR, and 2,454 bp of 3&#x27; sequence.  We found heterozygous FAM58A point mutations in the remaining cases (Fig. 1j, Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 1). In case 2, we identified the mutation 555+1G&amp;gt;A, affecting the splice donor site of intron 4. In case 4, we identified the frameshift mutation 201dupT, which immediately results in a premature stop codon N68XfsX1. In cases 5 and 6, we detected the mutation 556-1G&amp;gt;A, which alters the splice acceptor site of intron 4. We validated the point mutations and deletions by independent rounds of PCR and sequencing or by qPCR. We confirmed paternity and de novo status of the point mutations and deletions in all sporadic cases. None of the mutations were seen in the DNA of 60 unaffected female controls, and no larger deletions involving FAM58A were found in 93 unrelated array-CGH investigations.  By analyzing X-chromosome inactivation (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 4 online), we found complete skewing of X inactivation in cases 1 and 3â€“6 and almost complete skewing in case 2, suggesting that cells carrying the mutation on the active X chromosome have a growth disadvantage during fetal development. Using RT-PCR on RNA from lymphoblastoid cells of case 2 (Supplementary Fig. 2), we did not find any aberrant splice products as additional evidence that the mutated allele is inactivated. Furthermore, FAM58A is subjected to X inactivation6. In cases 1 and 3, the parental origin of the deletions could not be determined, as a result of lack of informative SNPs. Case 5, the mother of case 6, gave birth to two boys, both clinically unaffected (samples not available). We cannot exclude that the condition is lethal in males. No fetal losses were reported from any of the families.  The function of FAM58A is unknown. The gene consists of five coding exons, and the 642-bp coding region encodes a protein of 214 amino acids. GenBank lists a mRNA length of 1,257 bp for the reference sequence (NM_152274.2). Expression of the gene (by EST data) was found in 27 of 48 adult tissues including kidney, colon, cervix and uterus, but not heart (NCBI expression viewer, UniGene Hs.496943). Expression was also noted in 24 of 26 listed tumor tissues as well as in embryo and fetus. Genes homologous to FAM58A (NCBI HomoloGene: 13362) are found on the X chromosome in the chimpanzee and the dog. The zebrafish has a similar gene on chromosome 23. However, in the mouse and rat, there are no true homologs. These species have similar but intronless genes on chromosomes 11 (mouse) and 10 (rat), most likely arising from a retrotransposon insertion event. On the murine X chromosome, the flanking genes Atp2b3 and Dusp9 are conserved, but only remnants of the FAM58A sequence can be detected.  FAM58A contains a cyclin-box-fold domain, a protein-binding domain found in cyclins with a role in cell cycle and transcription control. No human phenotype resulting from a cyclin gene mutation has yet been reported. Homozygous knockout mice for Ccnd1 (encoding cyclin D1) are viable but small and have reduced lifespan. They also have dystrophic changes of the retina, likely as a result of decreased cell proliferation and degeneration of photoreceptor cells during embryogenesis7, 8.  Cyclin D1 colocalizes with SALL4 in the nucleus, and both proteins cooperatively mediate transcriptional repression9. As the phenotype of our cases overlaps considerably with that of Townes-Brocks syndrome caused by SALL1 mutations1, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation to find out if SALL1 or SALL4 would interact with FAM58A in a manner similar to that observed for SALL4 and cyclin D1. We found that FAM58A interacts with SALL1 but not with SALL4 (Supplementary Fig. 5 online), supporting the hypothesis that FAM58A and SALL1 participate in the same developmental pathway.  How do FAM58A mutations lead to STAR syndrome? Growth retardation (all cases; Table 1) and retinal abnormalities (three cases) are reminiscent of the reduced body size and retinal anomalies in cyclin D1 knockout mice7, 8. Therefore, a proliferation defect might be partly responsible for STAR syndrome. To address this question, we carried out a knockdown of FAM58A mRNA followed by a proliferation assay. Transfection of HEK293 cells with three different FAM58A-specific RNAi oligonucleotides resulted in a significant reduction of both FAM58A mRNA expression and proliferation of transfected cells (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 6 online), supporting the link between FAM58A and cell proliferation.  We found that loss-of-function mutations of FAM58A result in a rather homogeneous clinical phenotype. The additional anomalies in case 1 are likely to result from an effect of the 40-kb deletion on expression of a neighboring gene, possibly ATP2B3 or DUSP9. However, we cannot exclude that the homogeneous phenotype results from an ascertainment bias and that FAM58A mutations, including missense changes, could result in a broader spectrum of malformations. The genes causing the overlapping phenotypes of STAR syndrome and Townes-Brocks syndrome seem to act in the same pathway. Of note, MYCN, a gene mutated in Feingold syndrome, is a direct regulator of cyclin D2 (refs. 10,11); thus, it is worth exploring whether the phenotypic similarities between Feingold and STAR syndrome might be explained by direct regulation of FAM58A by MYCN.  FAM58A is located approximately 0.56 Mb centromeric to MECP2 on Xq28. Duplications overlapping both MECP2 and FAM58A have been described and are not associated with a clinical phenotype in females12, but no deletions overlapping both MECP2 and FAM58A have been observed to date13. Although other genes between FAM58A and MECP2 have been implicated in brain development, FAM58A and MECP2 are the only genes in this region known to result in X-linked dominant phenotypes; thus, deletion of both genes on the same allele might be lethal in both males and females.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;Abstract Background  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with a number of genetic and proteomic alterations. c-CBL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor molecule important in normal homeostasis and cancer. We determined the genetic variations of c-CBL, relationship to receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR and MET), and functionality in NSCLC.  Methods and Findings  Using archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) extracted genomic DNA, we show that c-CBL mutations occur in somatic fashion for lung cancers. c-CBL mutations were not mutually exclusive of MET or EGFR mutations; however they were independent of p53 and KRAS mutations. In normal/tumor pairwise analysis, there was significant loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the c-CBL locus (22%, nâ€Š=â€Š8/37) and none of these samples revealed any mutation in the remaining copy of c-CBL. The c-CBL LOH also positively correlated with EGFR and MET mutations observed in the same samples. Using select c-CBL somatic mutations such as S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* (obtained from Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American samples, respectively) transfected in NSCLC cell lines, there was increased cell viability and cell motility.  Conclusions  Taking the overall mutation rate of c-CBL to be a combination as somatic missense mutation and LOH, it is clear that c-CBL is highly mutated in lung cancers and may play an essential role in lung tumorigenesis and metastasis.  Go to: Introduction In the US alone, each year approximately 219,400 people are diagnosed with lung cancers, out of which more than 145,000 of them succumb to the disease [1]. This number is roughly equivalent to the combined mortality rates of cancers of the breast, prostate, colon, liver, kidney and melanoma [1]. In addition the prognosis is usually poor and the five-year survival rate is less than 15%. There are also significant ethnic differences for lung cancer, and the outcome is worse for blacks compared to whites. Gender differences are also striking with women having significantly better prognosis as compared to men. There are a number of genetic alterations that can occur in lung cancer. As an example, in NSCLC, mutations in KRAS, p53, EGFR and MET have been identified. Many of these pathways, especially Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are controlled by c-CBL.  CBL (Casitas B-lineage lymphoma) is a mammalian gene located on human chromosome 11q23.3 [2] and is involved in cell signaling and protein ubiquitination [3]. CBL proteins belong to the RING finger class of ubiquitin ligases (E3) and there are three homologues c-CBL, CBL-b, CBL-3 [4]. The c-CBL and CBL-b genes are ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels in hematopoietic tissues [5]. c-CBL consists of four regions encoding for functionally distinct protein domains: the N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, the linker region, the catalytic RING finger domain, the proline-rich region and the c-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain that also overlaps with a leucine-zipper (LZ) domain [3]. Both TKB and RING finger domains are essential for ligand-induced ubiquitination of RTKs [6], [7], [8], [9]. The RING finger domain is required for the recruitment of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The TKB domain includes four-helix bundle (4H), a calcium-biding EF hand, and a modified SH2 domain, which binds to phosphotyrosine residues [3], [10], [11], [12]. In addition, the proline-rich region of c-CBL can associate with the SH3 domain of Grb2, which can indirectly recruit c-CBL to RTKs via the GRB2 adaptor protein [7], [13], [14].  c-CBL also binds to EGFR and acts as the E3 that targets EGFR for ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, CBL desensitizes EGF signaling and opposes cellular proliferation induced by EGF [15]. EGF activation also appears to activate the tyrosine kinase SRC, which phosphorylates c-CBL and in turn activates the ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR [16], [17], [18]. A recent study shows that defective endocytosis of EGFR is characterized by a deletion mutant and the point mutation L858R, whereby its association with c-CBL and subsequent ubiquitination are impaired [19]. Recently, the first human c-CBL mutations were reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients [20]. The mutation R420Q inhibits FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20].  Not only can E3 activity be important in oncogenesis, c-CBL has a dual but separate function as a signal transduction molecule. We have previously shown that c-CBL is important in binding CRKL and BCR/ABL in hematopoietic cells. Also, it can bind and modulate functions of cytoskeleton by binding to proteins like talin and paxillin. The TKB domain is important in binding to a number of molecules, and they then function in signal transduction.  Given the critical role of CBL in normal homeostasis and cancer, we hypothesized that it might be mutated in lung cancers. In this study, we report novel c-CBL somatic mutations S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* in Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American lung cancer patients, respectively. Expressing these mutations in NSCLC cell lines lead to increased proliferation and cell motility. We show that c-CBL mutations occur with or without MET or EGFR mutations but are mutually exclusive of a LOH at the c-CBL locus. Additionally, c-CBL LOH is associated with either MET or EGFR mutations. We thus hypothesize that c-CBL mutations might contribute to the oncogenic potential of MET and EGFR in lung cancer.  Go to: Methods Ethics Statement  Written consent on all research on human subjects has been obtained from the Institutional Review Board, University of Chicago and covers all research performed in the laboratory. The following is their contact information: Institutional Review Board, The University of Chicago, McGiffert Hall, 5751 S. Woodlawn Ave., 2nd floor, Chicago, IL 60637. Written informed consents were received from all patients whose tissue samples were used for this study.  Tissue Samples  Lung cancer tissue and paired adjacent normal lung tissues were obtained from 50 Caucasian, 29 African-Americans and 40 Taiwanese NSCLC patients who were recruited at the University of Chicago Hospital (Chicago, USA) (Caucasian and African-American patients) and Taipei Veterans General Hospital of Taiwan (Taiwanese patients) after obtaining appropriate Institutional Review Board permission and informed consent from the patients. Out of 119 samples, 77 were men, 38 were women and 4 were unknown with age at diagnosis ranging from 47 to 90 years. In terms of tumor types, 53 were adenocarcinoma, 32 were squamous cell carcinoma and 34 were large cell carcinoma. 49 were stage I, 14 were stage II, 34 were stage III, and 13 were stage IV (Table S1).  Cell Culture  Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells A549 and H358 were maintained in DMEM and RPMI-1640, respectively. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in DMEM. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 Âµg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were cultured at 37Â°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.  c-CBL Gene Mutational Analysis  Exons 2 to 16 of c-CBL gene were individually amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers are listed in Table S2. PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 95Â°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of 94Â°C for 30 seconds, 58Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 2 minutes; and one cycle of 72Â°C for 10 minutes. PCR products were treated with ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) and sequenced by Big-Dye Terminator Chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing was performed on the forward coding strand with confirmation of c-CBL alterations performed by sequencing the reverse strand as well. Chromatograms were analyzed for mutations using Mutation Surveyor v2.61 (Softgenetics, State College, PA).  Plasmid Constructs and Site-Directed Mutagenesis  The wild-type c-CBL cDNA insert was subcloned into the pAlterMax expression vector using XhoI and SalI restriction enzyme sites (Promega, Madison, WI). Using this parental plasmid pAlterMax-c-CBL, the TKB domain double mutation (S80N/H94Y), the point mutation (Q249E), and the C-terminal point mutation W802* of c-CBL were created using the following primers: 5â€²-GCTGGCGCTAAAGAATAACCCACCTTATATCTTAGAC-3â€² and 5â€²-CTACCAGATACCTACCAGTATCTCCGTACTATCTTGTC-3â€² for the double mutation S80N/H94Y; 5â€²-CTTTACCCGACTCTTTGAGCCCTGGTCCTCTTTGC-3â€² for Q249E, and 5â€²-CAGCTCCTCCTTTGGCTGATTGTCTCTGGATGGTGATC-3â€² for W802* along with their complementary primers using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis XL kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions. The constructs were confirmed for the point mutations by standard DNA sequencing of both strands.  Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) Analysis  Five microsatellites on chromosome 11 (3 on 11q at or within 200 kb up or downstream of the c-CBL gene and 2 control markers on 11p) were selected for analysis (Table S3). Established microsatellite markers and respective primer sequences were selected from the GeneLoc database (http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/geneloc/index.shtml, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). Primers were custom designed and each forward primer was fluorescently labeled at the 5â€² end with FAM, PET, NED, or VIC (Applied Biosystems). Primer annealing temperatures and duplex scores were evaluated with NIST Primer Tools (http://yellow.nist.gov:8444/dnaAnalysis/primerToolsPage.do; National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD). Primers were verified by performing PCR with control DNA (isolated from TK6 cells) and resolving the products on agarose gels. Bands were visualized with an UV transilluminator. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor samples and paired normal lung tissue. Primers were grouped into multiplex combinations shown in Table S4. Marker D11S929 served as an internal control to check for consistency in PCRs and of peaks from capillary electrophoresis. Multiplex PCRs were carried out in a volume of 10 ÂµL that contained 1 ÂµL genomic DNA (20â€“50 ng), 0.5 ÂµM of each primer (1.0 ÂµM total for each primer pair), 400 ÂµM dNTPs, 1X PCR buffer containing MgCl2, and 0.2 U Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was performed on the ABI GeneAmp 9700 PCR System under the following conditions: 5 min at 94Â°C; 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94Â°C, 1 min at 60Â°C, 1 min at 72Â°C; and 5 min at 72Â°C. The PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3130XL DNA Analyzer. Chromatograms were analyzed with Peak Scanner 1.0 and GeneMapper 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems) for allelic alterations. The area of the peaks produced by the DNA PCR products was quantified for each allele. The ratio of the allelic areas was calculated for each tumor and paired normal DNA sample. When the qLOH (allelic ratio for the tumor peaks divided by the allelic ratio of paired normal sample) was â‰¤0.5 or â‰¥2.0 for c-CBL and at least one other 11q marker in at least two separate experiments, the sample was considered as having an allelic imbalance and interpreted as LOH. Samples were evaluated in at least two separate experiments and samples showing prospective LOH at c-CBL repeated a third time which included a new control marker at the BAX locus (data not shown) on chromosome 19 to verify integrity of sample DNA.  Transfection of c-Cbl Constructs  The A549 cell line was transfected using the Fugene HD (Roche, Nutley, NJ) reagent according to the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions. Eight Âµg of plasmid DNA, containing either no insert (empty vector), wild-type c-CBL, S80N/H94Y c-CBL, Q249E c-CBL or W802* CBL was used for transfection in a 6-well culture plate. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and analyzed for expression.  c-CBL Knockdown  c-CBL knockdown was performed using lentiviral transduction using MISSION lentiviral transduction particles (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as per manufacturer&#x27;s instructions. Briefly, 1Ã—105 H358 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and infected the following day with c-CBL lentiviral shRNA constructs. To generate stable c-CBL knockdown cell lines, cells were selected for 2 days with 1 Âµg/ml puromycin. c-CBL levels were determined using whole cell lysates by immunoblotting with anti-CBL antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA).  Cell Viability Assay  Cells were transfected as described above in the transfection assay. Forty-eight hours after transfection, viability of cells was assessed using Trypan Blue exclusion.  Wound Healing Assay  A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for 48 h until 100% confluent. The medium was then changed and the cells were transfected as described in the transfection assay. Twelve hours after transfection, a straight scratch was made across the cell layer using a 1 ml pipette tip. The cells were then gently washed with 1Ã— PBS to remove cellular debris and the media was replaced. Photographs were taken of the wound region every 12 h until 48 h.  Western Blot Analysis  Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were collected and washed twice in 1X PBS, then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5M Tris-HCl with pH 7.4, 1.5 M NaCl, 2.5% deoxycholic acid, 10 mM EDTA, 10% NP-40, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 Âµg/mL leupeptin, and 10 Âµg/mL aprotinin) for 5 minutes. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4Â°C, and protein content of the supernatant was measured. Total cell lysates (50 Âµg/well) were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and the gels transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (PBST) (1X PBS, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at 4Â°C overnight. Membranes then were washed three times with PBST and probed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were again washed three times in PBST and bands were visualized using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (BioRad, Valencia, CA) on a Chemidoc Gel documentation system (BioRad, Valencia, CA). Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies and used at the following dilutions (c-CBL, 1âˆ¶5000; c-MET, 1âˆ¶5000; EGFR, 1âˆ¶5000; ubiquitin, 1âˆ¶1000; HA, 1âˆ¶5000 and Î²-actin, 1âˆ¶10,000).  Flow Cytometry  Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Approximately 2Ã—106 cells were grown in media containing 10% FBS. Cells were harvested by trypsin/EDTA treatment, washed with 1X PBS three times and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 2 h. Cells were washed again with cold PBS and stained with a solution containing 25 Âµg/mL propidium iodide, 200 Âµg/mL RNase A, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes in the dark. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Guava PCA-96 flow cytometer (Guava Technologies, Millipore, Billerica, MA).  Ubiquitin Ligase Activity  293T cells were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 Âµg/mL) were transfected with 0.2 Âµg EGFR-pcDNA3 and 2 Âµg HA-tagged c-CBL constructs as indicated using calcium phosphate according to manufacturer&#x27;s protocol (Profection, Promega, Madison, WI). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were starved overnight in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS, and then treated with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cells were collected and washed two times in ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X100, 10% Glycerol, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors). Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C. EGFR immunoprecipitations were performed on 200 Âµg of cleared lysate using 250 ng of rabbit-anti-EGFR and Protein A/G Plus Sepharose overnight at 4Â°C. Precipitations were washed 5 times in lysis buffer before boiling in Laemmli buffer. Elutions were immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin and EGFR. Twenty micrograms of cleared lysate were immunoblotted for each of the c-CBL constructs using anti-HA.  Statistical Analysis  Mutation rates between different groups were compared using Fisher&#x27;s exact test. For continuous variables, group comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Sidak&#x27;s adjustment for multiple comparisons. Experiments involving repeated measurements over time were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with the Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment to the degrees of freedom. Analyses were conducted using STATA (v10.1) software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).  Go to: Results c-CBL Gene Mutations in Lung Cancer  To investigate the role of c-CBL in lung cancer, we analyzed its genomic DNA in tumor and paired normal samples drawn from multiple ethnicities. The lung tumor samples represented Caucasians (nâ€Š=â€Š50), African-Americans (nâ€Š=â€Š29), and Taiwanese (nâ€Š=â€Š40) lung cancer patients. We designed 12 pairs of primers to sequence the coding region of c-CBL gene that spans exons 2 to 16 (Table S2). We identified 8 unique somatic mutations in c-CBL exons among 8 different patients. A variation L620F, a known SNP (rs2227988) in exon 11 was also detected. Importantly, the eight novel non-synonymous mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands of c-CBL genomic DNA obtained from lung tumor samples (Table 1). Moreover, none of the 8 mutations were detected in the corresponding normal tissue, indicating that these were somatic mutations. Four synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were also identified but were not used further in this study.  Table 1 Table 1 c-CBL mutation analysis in 119 lung cancer patient tumor tissues. Three of the 8 novel non-synonymous mutations were located in the TKB (tyrosine kinase binding) domain (S80N, H94Y, and Q249E), one in the RING finger domain (V391I), one in the proline-rich region (72515_72517 del ATG), and three in the C-terminal region (W802*, R830K, and A848T) of the c-CBL protein (Figure 1A and Figure S1). In Figure 1B, we show model chromatograms of representative samples.  Figure 1 Figure 1 c-CBL mutations and LOH in non-small cell lung cancer. 11q LOH of c-CBL Gene  Paired lung tumor and normal lung tissue samples from Taiwanese patients (nâ€Š=â€Š37) were investigated for LOH. Eight (21.6%) showed LOH at the c-CBL locus on chromosome 11 while 29 samples (78.4%) revealed normal allelic contribution at the microsatellite markers (Figures 1C and D).  c-CBL Mutations in Different Ethnic Groups  The c-CBL double mutant S80N/H94Y was found in the same patient and the overall mutation rate for c-CBL in lung tumors was 6.7% (8/119). The frequency of c-CBL mutation was highest in large cell carcinoma (14.7%; 5 of 34 patients) followed by squamous carcinoma (6.3%; 2 of 32 patients) and the least was observed in adenocarcinoma (AD) (1.8%; 1 of 53 patients), although these rates were not statistically significant (pâ€Š=â€Š0.292). Mutation rates were 6.0% among Caucasians (0 of 20 in AD; 0 of 10 in SQ; and 3 of 20 in LC), 13.8% in African-Americans (1 of 10 in AD; 1 of 10 in SQ; and 2 of 9 in LC), and 2.5% (0 of 23 in AD; 1 of 12 in SQ; and 0 of 5 in LC) in the Taiwanese population. Additionally two Taiwanese patients with lung cancer (one squamous and one adenocarcinoma) had the known SNP L620F. Ethnic differences were not statistically significant, however the power to detect differences was low.  Mutations in MET and EGFR Can Be Co-Associated with c-CBL Alterations  Since East Asians with lung cancer have a higher frequency of EGFR and MET mutations in lung tumors [21], [22], we also determined mutations in EGFR and MET in the same Taiwanese cohort samples and compared the results with the observed c-CBL alterations (LOH and/or mutations). In the 37 samples tested, we did not find any overlap between c-CBL mutations and c-CBL LOH (Figure 2). Of the three c-CBL mutants (including the known L620F SNP, rs2227988), one of the samples had a MET mutation (N375S) and the other had an EGFR mutation (L858R). Among the 8 samples that had a LOH at the c-CBL locus 5 had an additional mutation in MET (N375S) and 2 had an EGFR exon 19 deletion. Twenty-six samples had neither c-CBL mutation nor c-CBL LOH (3 patients had a c-CBL mutation but no c-CBL LOH). Among these 26 samples 9 had a MET mutation (8 N375S, 1 L211W), 13 had an EGFR mutation (7 exon 9 deletion, 6 L858R) and 4 had no other MET or EGFR mutation. Thus the rate of MET or EGFR mutations among patients with LOH at the c-CBL locus (7 of 8) was similar to that seen in patients without c-CBL mutation or LOH (22 of 26 patients) (pâ€Š=â€Š0.99). These 4 patients with no identifiable mutation in c-CBL, MET or EGFR represented 10.8% of the 37 patients analyzed in the Taiwanese patient cohort. Conversely, 89.2% Taiwanese lung cancer patients have an identifiable mutation in either c-CBL, MET or EGFR or a combination of the three genes (Figure 2). Additionally, we determined p53 and KRAS mutations in these Taiwanese cohorts. Two p53 and 1 KRAS mutation were detected. The single KRAS mutation overlapped with one p53 mutation. This patient also had the EGFR exon 19 deletion but had no c-CBL mutation. The other p53 mutation sample had a c-CBL LOH with concurrent MET N375S mutation. Thus, in the Taiwanese samples analyzed, p53/KRAS mutations and c-CBL mutations were mutually exclusive (data not shown).  Figure 2 Figure 2 c-CBL mutations and relationship to MET and EGFR mutations in lung cancer. Cellular Functions of c-CBL Alterations in the Context of Lung Tumorigenesis  A. E3 activity is intact in the mutant c-CBL proteins To investigate whether the different c-CBL mutations affect the E3 activity, EGFR was chosen as a model substrate for c-CBL E3 function. All of the c-CBL mutants tested enhanced ubiquitination of the activated EGFR similar to the wild-type c-CBL protein. This result demonstrates that the catalytic activity of the c-CBL mutants is not impaired when EGFR was the substrate. (Figure 3A).

Effect on lung cancer cell viability The effect of a representative c-CBL mutant from each of the three ethnic backgrounds on lung cancer cell viability in cell lines was determined. S80N/H94Y double mutation, Q249E, and W802* were identified in lung tumor samples obtained from a Caucasian, a Taiwanese and an African-American, respectively. As described in methods, the c-CBL wild-type (WT) and the above three mutants were expressed after cloning them into pAlterMax vector in A549 cells. These cells express relatively low basal levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). Transfection efficiency was comparable between different groups and the number of cells transfected with c-CBL wild-type construct was about 70% compared to control cells that were transfected with the empty vector. Cells transfected with S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* c-CBL mutant constructs resulted in increased number of viable cells that was 132.3%, 120.8% and 147.9% higher respectively, relative to the empty vector control transfected cells and significantly different from the wild-type construct (pâ€Š=â€Š0.022, pâ€Š=â€Š0.049, and pâ€Š=â€Š0.008, respectively) (Figure 3B). Relative levels of c-CBL protein in whole cell lysates prepared from samples obtained from a parallel experiment was determined. The c-CBL protein levels in samples representing untransfected and empty vector transfected cells were comparable and those representing the c-CBL WT and the three c-CBL mutants were comparable (Figure 3C).  C. Effect on cell cycle To investigate if the increases in cell viability in different c-CBL mutants are due to increased cellular proliferation, a cell cycle analysis was performed. A549 cells were transfected with the c-CBL WT or the three different mutants: S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*. The empty vector transfectant was used as a control. Forty-eight hours after transfection cell cycle analysis was performed as described in materials and methods. There was no significant change in the subG1, G1 or the S phase of the cell cycle among the different mutants compared to the WT construct (pâ€Š=â€Š0.64, pâ€Š=â€Š0.40, and pâ€Š=â€Š0.28, respectively). The G2/M phase of the cell cycle showed an increase in cell numbers for the three mutants, S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*, when compared to the WT but again the difference was not statistically significant (pâ€Š=â€Š0.25) (Figure 3D).  D. Effect on cell motility To investigate the effect of the expression of the above three c-CBL mutants on cell migration, we carried out wound healing assay as described in materials and methods. The closing of the scratch or the wound was monitored at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. (Figure 4A). In all the samples, that represented cells transfected with mutants, the wound gap was much smaller than that seen in the sample that represented cells transfected with c-CBL WT (p&amp;lt;0.001). We also determined the rate of wound closure for all the five groups. At 48 h, wild-type c-CBL transfectants showed 61.1% open wound while the S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* mutants showed 18.7%, 23.9% and 34.3% open wound respectively (p&amp;lt;0.001) (Figure 4B).  Figure 4 Figure 4 c-CBL mutations affect wound healing in A549 cells. E. c-CBL knockdown increases cell viability It is hypothesized that the LOH seen in our samples could lead to decreased expression of c-CBL. Thus we tested the effect of c-CBL knockdown in lung cancer cells. Compared to A549, H358 lung cancer cells express relatively high levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). c-CBL expression was knocked down using lentiviral construct that expressed c-CBL specific shRNA and compared the results with those that were transduced with scrambled shRNA and the results are shown in Figure 5. We identified several clones that revealed varying degrees of c-CBL knockdown showing different sets of c-CBL lentiviral shRNA knockdown efficiency (Figure 5A). Of all the clones tested, Clone 27 was chosen for further experiments. Equal amount of cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and the cell proliferation was measured at various times and the results are depicted in Figure 5B. As expected, number of cells increased in a time dependent fashion from 100 to 190% relative to scrambled shRNA as control in a span of 48 h (pâ€Š=â€Š0.0002) (Figure 5B). The cell cycle phases in H358 cells that were knocked down with c-CBL shRNA were looked at and compared with the scrambled shRNA. There were no discernable differences between these two constructs in the different phases of the cell cycle (data not shown).  Figure 5 Figure 5 Knockdown of c-CBL using an shRNA increases cell proliferation. Go to: Discussion Our results demonstrate that c-CBL is somatically mutated (or has LOH) in lung cancers, and can significantly contribute to enhanced cell viability and motility. There was also a high prevalence of LOH with respect to c-CBL in lung tumors that harbored MET or EGFR mutation.  In the present study, we have demonstrated the occurrence of c-CBL mutations in lung cancer patients, especially with different ancestral variations. Mutations in c-CBL have been recently reported in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and myeloid malignancies. In the AML study, the mutation R420Q located in the junction of the RING finger and the linker region inhibited FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20], thus contributing to the gain-in-function for the RTK. In addition, mutations such as H398Y, C384R, and L380P mapped to the RING finger domain and the linker region of c-CBL that is required for its E3 activity [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Additionally, homozygous mutations in the RING finger domain of the c-CBL gene were described as a result of acquired Uniparental Disomy (UPD) [26]. It is important to note that our results indicate LOH at 11q23 locus and these are mutually exclusive from missense mutations of c-CBL. The somatic mutations were all heterozygous. The mutations in AML led to abrogation of the E3 activity leading to prolonged RTK activation. In addition mutants located on the linker region surrounding the RING finger domain exhibited enhanced AKT signaling in response to cytokine stimulation [26]. In addition, it was shown in NH3T3 cells, that neither mutations in the RING finger nor the linker region causes transformation, however while certain mutations perturbs the ubiquitination, others affect receptor recycling and prolong kinase activity [28].  We report here c-CBL mutations that mapped not only to the RING finger domain, but also to the TKB domain, proline-rich domain and the C-terminal region, but none mapped to the linker region as reported in the AML studies described above [23], [24], [25], [26], [29]. In addition, 8 mutants that we detected were found in different ethnic backgrounds. For example, S80N/H94Y, Q249E, W802* were detected in Caucasians, Taiwanese and African-Americans, respectively. The results point out not only the difference between lung cancer and other cancers, but also genetic polymorphism among different races in the same cancer. Interestingly, there is a large disparity between African-American and other ethnic populations with lung cancer [30]. We have previously shown that there was a low frequency of EGFR and MET mutation in African-Americans as compared with Taiwanese and Caucasians [31]. In this study, the number of African-American samples analyzed was relatively fewer and we found 3 mutations that are unique to this ethnicity. It would now behoove us to further study the genetic alterations that can occur and determine the targeted therapeutics for African-Americans. Our results provide evidence of the importance of c-CBL in tumorigenesis and potential signaling. Our prediction, based on the AML data, would be that the V391I RING finger domain mutation would affect the E3 activity. Also, it will be important to determine the binding partners for c-CBL in the TKB domain and proline rich domain mutations. It has previously been shown that the TKB domain can bind to growth factor receptors and it will be important to determine the cross-binding of these mutants to MET and or EGFR. It would also be important in the future to look at fluorescence in situ hybridization/copy number changes in c-CBL in lung cancer.  c-CBL plays an important role in down regulating RTK-mediated signaling through K63 poly-ubiquitination and subsequent downregulation of RTKs followed by lysosomal degredation [3]. Mono-ubiquitination or ubiquitinated with K63-linked chains of substrates by c-CBL may lead to enhancement of biological and biochemical functions (reviewed in Hermann et al, 2007 [32]). The mutations that we analyzed in our studies all point out to the fact that the E3 activity of c-CBL on EGFR is intact; the EGFR levels in the various mutants remain same (Figure S2). Multiple kinases, both RTKs and non-RTKs could be acted upon by c-CBL, including ERBs, PDGFR, FMS, MET, c-Kit, VEGFR, FLT-1, RON, FGFR, IR, as well as SYK, FYN, LCK, FGR, LYN and c-ABL [3]. In lung cancers the relevant substrates of c-CBL in terms of degradation or signal transduction are yet to be identified.  The observation that c-CBL somatic mutations, especially S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* showed increased cell viability and cell motility that is in agreement with the physiological role for D-cbl in the regulation of apoptosis and differentiation identified in Drosophila is very significant [33]. It has been previously shown that activating c-CBL mutation downregulates EGFR signaling and decreases cellular proliferation and migration in breast cancer cell lines [34]. Although the role of c-CBL in the negative regulation of RTKs is well substantiated, thereby suggesting that it is a natural tumor suppressor, studies in cancer cells have revealed both tumor suppressor and tumor promoting activities depending on the type of c-CBL mutation and the number of alleles at the c-CBL locus [24]. In agreement with the above, the three c-CBL mutants described here appear to have tumor growth and metastasis promoting properties. Although these mutants are outside of the RING finger or the linker region of c-CBL, their downstream effects are significant so as to cause increased proliferation and migration, but the substrate affected by these mutations are not known yet. This raises the possibility that some of the cellular functions of c-CBL are independent of its ubiquitin-ligase activity, an area that we are currently investigating. The oncogenic nature of RTKs, addiction of cancers to growth signals and given the clustering of c-CBL, EGFR and MET mutations, it is possible that the transforming effect of c-CBL mutations is most likely a combinatorial effect of the three. We also show that LOH for c-CBL was found in a significant number of samples that harbored MET or EGFR mutations. The fact that about 7% of lung tumor samples are likely to have c-CBL mutations and an additional 22% are likely to harbor c-CBL-related LOH, makes c-CBL a highly mutated molecule in lung cancer. Since LOH alone is not enough to cause a transforming event [35], [36], [37], associated mutation in the MET or EGFR locus or yet another RTK discussed above may play a role in carcinogenesis. We predict that this LOH in c-CBL results in haploinsufficiency that downplays RTK ubiquitination leading to hyperactivity of the RTKs. However, whether this is sufficient cause for tumorigenesis remains to be determined. Consistent with our hypothesis is the fact that c-cbl-/- mice have increased kinase activity in lymphocytes, but is not sufficient for tumor formation [35], [36], [37]. c-CBL LOH could also lead to increased expression of c-CBL from the other allele to compensate for a loss of an allele. Alternately, there could be some form of synergy working with reduced c-CBL levels and mutated receptors that exacerbate the phenotype of each alone.  Previous studies from our lab and others have shown that East Asians with lung cancers have relatively high frequencies of gain-of-function of mutations in RTKs such as EGFR and MET [31]. In a cohort of Japanese patients an activating MET mutation was identified in the splice region that deletes the juxtamembrane domain that is involved E3 activity of c-CBL [38]. This study also found that activation of MET is mutually exclusive of EGFR, KRAS and HER2 gene mutations [38]. We failed to detect such mutations in significant numbers in lung tumor samples obtained from African-Americans (nâ€Š=â€Š29) and Caucasian (nâ€Š=â€Š50) patients. One MET mutation was identified in each of the groups whereas 1 and 3 EGFR mutations were identified in the African-American and Caucasian cohorts respectively. EGFR mutations have earlier been identified as one of the key mutations affecting lung adenocarcinoma patients in a comprehensive study of 188 patients [39]. Our study encompasses different histologies of NSCLC. However, the published series did not find any mutations in c-CBL or MET unlike our study that encompassed different subtypes of NSCLC. It is important to note, we have recently shown that MET mutations in lung cancer are in majority germline [31]. We have reported earlier c-CBL mutations in a small cohort of Taiwanese lung cancer samples [40]. In our efforts to understand the ethnic differences in the lung oncogenome, we also looked at PAX transcription factors such as PAX5 and PAX8 that are highly expressed in lung cancers; however there was no preferential expression or mutations of the above genes in lung tumor samples of African-Americans. In this study, we show relatively high frequency of c-CBL mutations in lung cancers, especially in the large cell type among Caucasians and particularly among African-Americans. We therefore propose c-CBL as an efficacious target for lung cancers in African-Americans that needs to be further substantiated. This is all the more important because the prognosis for African-Americans with lung cancer, especially for men is much poorer compared to their Caucasian counterparts [41].  In conclusion, the results presented in this study demonstrate that c-CBL is frequently mutated or even lost in lung cancers. Our results support a role for c-CBL mutants that are independent of its ubiquitination activity. Given the relatively high mutation rates in c-CBL as well as RTKs such as MET and EGFR, it is likely that their combined effect could be synergistic in promoting tumorigenesis.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;Abstract Background  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with a number of genetic and proteomic alterations. c-CBL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor molecule important in normal homeostasis and cancer. We determined the genetic variations of c-CBL, relationship to receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR and MET), and functionality in NSCLC.  Methods and Findings  Using archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) extracted genomic DNA, we show that c-CBL mutations occur in somatic fashion for lung cancers. c-CBL mutations were not mutually exclusive of MET or EGFR mutations; however they were independent of p53 and KRAS mutations. In normal/tumor pairwise analysis, there was significant loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the c-CBL locus (22%, nâ€Š=â€Š8/37) and none of these samples revealed any mutation in the remaining copy of c-CBL. The c-CBL LOH also positively correlated with EGFR and MET mutations observed in the same samples. Using select c-CBL somatic mutations such as S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* (obtained from Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American samples, respectively) transfected in NSCLC cell lines, there was increased cell viability and cell motility.  Conclusions  Taking the overall mutation rate of c-CBL to be a combination as somatic missense mutation and LOH, it is clear that c-CBL is highly mutated in lung cancers and may play an essential role in lung tumorigenesis and metastasis.  Go to: Introduction In the US alone, each year approximately 219,400 people are diagnosed with lung cancers, out of which more than 145,000 of them succumb to the disease [1]. This number is roughly equivalent to the combined mortality rates of cancers of the breast, prostate, colon, liver, kidney and melanoma [1]. In addition the prognosis is usually poor and the five-year survival rate is less than 15%. There are also significant ethnic differences for lung cancer, and the outcome is worse for blacks compared to whites. Gender differences are also striking with women having significantly better prognosis as compared to men. There are a number of genetic alterations that can occur in lung cancer. As an example, in NSCLC, mutations in KRAS, p53, EGFR and MET have been identified. Many of these pathways, especially Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are controlled by c-CBL.  CBL (Casitas B-lineage lymphoma) is a mammalian gene located on human chromosome 11q23.3 [2] and is involved in cell signaling and protein ubiquitination [3]. CBL proteins belong to the RING finger class of ubiquitin ligases (E3) and there are three homologues c-CBL, CBL-b, CBL-3 [4]. The c-CBL and CBL-b genes are ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels in hematopoietic tissues [5]. c-CBL consists of four regions encoding for functionally distinct protein domains: the N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, the linker region, the catalytic RING finger domain, the proline-rich region and the c-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain that also overlaps with a leucine-zipper (LZ) domain [3]. Both TKB and RING finger domains are essential for ligand-induced ubiquitination of RTKs [6], [7], [8], [9]. The RING finger domain is required for the recruitment of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The TKB domain includes four-helix bundle (4H), a calcium-biding EF hand, and a modified SH2 domain, which binds to phosphotyrosine residues [3], [10], [11], [12]. In addition, the proline-rich region of c-CBL can associate with the SH3 domain of Grb2, which can indirectly recruit c-CBL to RTKs via the GRB2 adaptor protein [7], [13], [14].  c-CBL also binds to EGFR and acts as the E3 that targets EGFR for ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, CBL desensitizes EGF signaling and opposes cellular proliferation induced by EGF [15]. EGF activation also appears to activate the tyrosine kinase SRC, which phosphorylates c-CBL and in turn activates the ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR [16], [17], [18]. A recent study shows that defective endocytosis of EGFR is characterized by a deletion mutant and the point mutation L858R, whereby its association with c-CBL and subsequent ubiquitination are impaired [19]. Recently, the first human c-CBL mutations were reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients [20]. The mutation R420Q inhibits FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20].  Not only can E3 activity be important in oncogenesis, c-CBL has a dual but separate function as a signal transduction molecule. We have previously shown that c-CBL is important in binding CRKL and BCR/ABL in hematopoietic cells. Also, it can bind and modulate functions of cytoskeleton by binding to proteins like talin and paxillin. The TKB domain is important in binding to a number of molecules, and they then function in signal transduction.  Given the critical role of CBL in normal homeostasis and cancer, we hypothesized that it might be mutated in lung cancers. In this study, we report novel c-CBL somatic mutations S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* in Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American lung cancer patients, respectively. Expressing these mutations in NSCLC cell lines lead to increased proliferation and cell motility. We show that c-CBL mutations occur with or without MET or EGFR mutations but are mutually exclusive of a LOH at the c-CBL locus. Additionally, c-CBL LOH is associated with either MET or EGFR mutations. We thus hypothesize that c-CBL mutations might contribute to the oncogenic potential of MET and EGFR in lung cancer.  Go to: Methods Ethics Statement  Written consent on all research on human subjects has been obtained from the Institutional Review Board, University of Chicago and covers all research performed in the laboratory. The following is their contact information: Institutional Review Board, The University of Chicago, McGiffert Hall, 5751 S. Woodlawn Ave., 2nd floor, Chicago, IL 60637. Written informed consents were received from all patients whose tissue samples were used for this study.  Tissue Samples  Lung cancer tissue and paired adjacent normal lung tissues were obtained from 50 Caucasian, 29 African-Americans and 40 Taiwanese NSCLC patients who were recruited at the University of Chicago Hospital (Chicago, USA) (Caucasian and African-American patients) and Taipei Veterans General Hospital of Taiwan (Taiwanese patients) after obtaining appropriate Institutional Review Board permission and informed consent from the patients. Out of 119 samples, 77 were men, 38 were women and 4 were unknown with age at diagnosis ranging from 47 to 90 years. In terms of tumor types, 53 were adenocarcinoma, 32 were squamous cell carcinoma and 34 were large cell carcinoma. 49 were stage I, 14 were stage II, 34 were stage III, and 13 were stage IV (Table S1).  Cell Culture  Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells A549 and H358 were maintained in DMEM and RPMI-1640, respectively. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in DMEM. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 Âµg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were cultured at 37Â°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.  c-CBL Gene Mutational Analysis  Exons 2 to 16 of c-CBL gene were individually amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers are listed in Table S2. PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 95Â°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of 94Â°C for 30 seconds, 58Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 2 minutes; and one cycle of 72Â°C for 10 minutes. PCR products were treated with ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) and sequenced by Big-Dye Terminator Chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing was performed on the forward coding strand with confirmation of c-CBL alterations performed by sequencing the reverse strand as well. Chromatograms were analyzed for mutations using Mutation Surveyor v2.61 (Softgenetics, State College, PA).  Plasmid Constructs and Site-Directed Mutagenesis  The wild-type c-CBL cDNA insert was subcloned into the pAlterMax expression vector using XhoI and SalI restriction enzyme sites (Promega, Madison, WI). Using this parental plasmid pAlterMax-c-CBL, the TKB domain double mutation (S80N/H94Y), the point mutation (Q249E), and the C-terminal point mutation W802* of c-CBL were created using the following primers: 5â€²-GCTGGCGCTAAAGAATAACCCACCTTATATCTTAGAC-3â€² and 5â€²-CTACCAGATACCTACCAGTATCTCCGTACTATCTTGTC-3â€² for the double mutation S80N/H94Y; 5â€²-CTTTACCCGACTCTTTGAGCCCTGGTCCTCTTTGC-3â€² for Q249E, and 5â€²-CAGCTCCTCCTTTGGCTGATTGTCTCTGGATGGTGATC-3â€² for W802* along with their complementary primers using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis XL kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions. The constructs were confirmed for the point mutations by standard DNA sequencing of both strands.  Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) Analysis  Five microsatellites on chromosome 11 (3 on 11q at or within 200 kb up or downstream of the c-CBL gene and 2 control markers on 11p) were selected for analysis (Table S3). Established microsatellite markers and respective primer sequences were selected from the GeneLoc database (http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/geneloc/index.shtml, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). Primers were custom designed and each forward primer was fluorescently labeled at the 5â€² end with FAM, PET, NED, or VIC (Applied Biosystems). Primer annealing temperatures and duplex scores were evaluated with NIST Primer Tools (http://yellow.nist.gov:8444/dnaAnalysis/primerToolsPage.do; National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD). Primers were verified by performing PCR with control DNA (isolated from TK6 cells) and resolving the products on agarose gels. Bands were visualized with an UV transilluminator. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor samples and paired normal lung tissue. Primers were grouped into multiplex combinations shown in Table S4. Marker D11S929 served as an internal control to check for consistency in PCRs and of peaks from capillary electrophoresis. Multiplex PCRs were carried out in a volume of 10 ÂµL that contained 1 ÂµL genomic DNA (20â€“50 ng), 0.5 ÂµM of each primer (1.0 ÂµM total for each primer pair), 400 ÂµM dNTPs, 1X PCR buffer containing MgCl2, and 0.2 U Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was performed on the ABI GeneAmp 9700 PCR System under the following conditions: 5 min at 94Â°C; 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94Â°C, 1 min at 60Â°C, 1 min at 72Â°C; and 5 min at 72Â°C. The PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3130XL DNA Analyzer. Chromatograms were analyzed with Peak Scanner 1.0 and GeneMapper 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems) for allelic alterations. The area of the peaks produced by the DNA PCR products was quantified for each allele. The ratio of the allelic areas was calculated for each tumor and paired normal DNA sample. When the qLOH (allelic ratio for the tumor peaks divided by the allelic ratio of paired normal sample) was â‰¤0.5 or â‰¥2.0 for c-CBL and at least one other 11q marker in at least two separate experiments, the sample was considered as having an allelic imbalance and interpreted as LOH. Samples were evaluated in at least two separate experiments and samples showing prospective LOH at c-CBL repeated a third time which included a new control marker at the BAX locus (data not shown) on chromosome 19 to verify integrity of sample DNA.  Transfection of c-Cbl Constructs  The A549 cell line was transfected using the Fugene HD (Roche, Nutley, NJ) reagent according to the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions. Eight Âµg of plasmid DNA, containing either no insert (empty vector), wild-type c-CBL, S80N/H94Y c-CBL, Q249E c-CBL or W802* CBL was used for transfection in a 6-well culture plate. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and analyzed for expression.  c-CBL Knockdown  c-CBL knockdown was performed using lentiviral transduction using MISSION lentiviral transduction particles (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as per manufacturer&#x27;s instructions. Briefly, 1Ã—105 H358 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and infected the following day with c-CBL lentiviral shRNA constructs. To generate stable c-CBL knockdown cell lines, cells were selected for 2 days with 1 Âµg/ml puromycin. c-CBL levels were determined using whole cell lysates by immunoblotting with anti-CBL antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA).  Cell Viability Assay  Cells were transfected as described above in the transfection assay. Forty-eight hours after transfection, viability of cells was assessed using Trypan Blue exclusion.  Wound Healing Assay  A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for 48 h until 100% confluent. The medium was then changed and the cells were transfected as described in the transfection assay. Twelve hours after transfection, a straight scratch was made across the cell layer using a 1 ml pipette tip. The cells were then gently washed with 1Ã— PBS to remove cellular debris and the media was replaced. Photographs were taken of the wound region every 12 h until 48 h.  Western Blot Analysis  Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were collected and washed twice in 1X PBS, then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5M Tris-HCl with pH 7.4, 1.5 M NaCl, 2.5% deoxycholic acid, 10 mM EDTA, 10% NP-40, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 Âµg/mL leupeptin, and 10 Âµg/mL aprotinin) for 5 minutes. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4Â°C, and protein content of the supernatant was measured. Total cell lysates (50 Âµg/well) were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and the gels transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (PBST) (1X PBS, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at 4Â°C overnight. Membranes then were washed three times with PBST and probed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were again washed three times in PBST and bands were visualized using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (BioRad, Valencia, CA) on a Chemidoc Gel documentation system (BioRad, Valencia, CA). Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies and used at the following dilutions (c-CBL, 1âˆ¶5000; c-MET, 1âˆ¶5000; EGFR, 1âˆ¶5000; ubiquitin, 1âˆ¶1000; HA, 1âˆ¶5000 and Î²-actin, 1âˆ¶10,000).  Flow Cytometry  Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Approximately 2Ã—106 cells were grown in media containing 10% FBS. Cells were harvested by trypsin/EDTA treatment, washed with 1X PBS three times and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 2 h. Cells were washed again with cold PBS and stained with a solution containing 25 Âµg/mL propidium iodide, 200 Âµg/mL RNase A, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes in the dark. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Guava PCA-96 flow cytometer (Guava Technologies, Millipore, Billerica, MA).  Ubiquitin Ligase Activity  293T cells were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 Âµg/mL) were transfected with 0.2 Âµg EGFR-pcDNA3 and 2 Âµg HA-tagged c-CBL constructs as indicated using calcium phosphate according to manufacturer&#x27;s protocol (Profection, Promega, Madison, WI). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were starved overnight in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS, and then treated with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cells were collected and washed two times in ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X100, 10% Glycerol, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors). Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C. EGFR immunoprecipitations were performed on 200 Âµg of cleared lysate using 250 ng of rabbit-anti-EGFR and Protein A/G Plus Sepharose overnight at 4Â°C. Precipitations were washed 5 times in lysis buffer before boiling in Laemmli buffer. Elutions were immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin and EGFR. Twenty micrograms of cleared lysate were immunoblotted for each of the c-CBL constructs using anti-HA.  Statistical Analysis  Mutation rates between different groups were compared using Fisher&#x27;s exact test. For continuous variables, group comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Sidak&#x27;s adjustment for multiple comparisons. Experiments involving repeated measurements over time were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with the Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment to the degrees of freedom. Analyses were conducted using STATA (v10.1) software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).  Go to: Results c-CBL Gene Mutations in Lung Cancer  To investigate the role of c-CBL in lung cancer, we analyzed its genomic DNA in tumor and paired normal samples drawn from multiple ethnicities. The lung tumor samples represented Caucasians (nâ€Š=â€Š50), African-Americans (nâ€Š=â€Š29), and Taiwanese (nâ€Š=â€Š40) lung cancer patients. We designed 12 pairs of primers to sequence the coding region of c-CBL gene that spans exons 2 to 16 (Table S2). We identified 8 unique somatic mutations in c-CBL exons among 8 different patients. A variation L620F, a known SNP (rs2227988) in exon 11 was also detected. Importantly, the eight novel non-synonymous mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands of c-CBL genomic DNA obtained from lung tumor samples (Table 1). Moreover, none of the 8 mutations were detected in the corresponding normal tissue, indicating that these were somatic mutations. Four synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were also identified but were not used further in this study.  Table 1 Table 1 c-CBL mutation analysis in 119 lung cancer patient tumor tissues. Three of the 8 novel non-synonymous mutations were located in the TKB (tyrosine kinase binding) domain (S80N, H94Y, and Q249E), one in the RING finger domain (V391I), one in the proline-rich region (72515_72517 del ATG), and three in the C-terminal region (W802*, R830K, and A848T) of the c-CBL protein (Figure 1A and Figure S1). In Figure 1B, we show model chromatograms of representative samples.  Figure 1 Figure 1 c-CBL mutations and LOH in non-small cell lung cancer. 11q LOH of c-CBL Gene  Paired lung tumor and normal lung tissue samples from Taiwanese patients (nâ€Š=â€Š37) were investigated for LOH. Eight (21.6%) showed LOH at the c-CBL locus on chromosome 11 while 29 samples (78.4%) revealed normal allelic contribution at the microsatellite markers (Figures 1C and D).  c-CBL Mutations in Different Ethnic Groups  The c-CBL double mutant S80N/H94Y was found in the same patient and the overall mutation rate for c-CBL in lung tumors was 6.7% (8/119). The frequency of c-CBL mutation was highest in large cell carcinoma (14.7%; 5 of 34 patients) followed by squamous carcinoma (6.3%; 2 of 32 patients) and the least was observed in adenocarcinoma (AD) (1.8%; 1 of 53 patients), although these rates were not statistically significant (pâ€Š=â€Š0.292). Mutation rates were 6.0% among Caucasians (0 of 20 in AD; 0 of 10 in SQ; and 3 of 20 in LC), 13.8% in African-Americans (1 of 10 in AD; 1 of 10 in SQ; and 2 of 9 in LC), and 2.5% (0 of 23 in AD; 1 of 12 in SQ; and 0 of 5 in LC) in the Taiwanese population. Additionally two Taiwanese patients with lung cancer (one squamous and one adenocarcinoma) had the known SNP L620F. Ethnic differences were not statistically significant, however the power to detect differences was low.  Mutations in MET and EGFR Can Be Co-Associated with c-CBL Alterations  Since East Asians with lung cancer have a higher frequency of EGFR and MET mutations in lung tumors [21], [22], we also determined mutations in EGFR and MET in the same Taiwanese cohort samples and compared the results with the observed c-CBL alterations (LOH and/or mutations). In the 37 samples tested, we did not find any overlap between c-CBL mutations and c-CBL LOH (Figure 2). Of the three c-CBL mutants (including the known L620F SNP, rs2227988), one of the samples had a MET mutation (N375S) and the other had an EGFR mutation (L858R). Among the 8 samples that had a LOH at the c-CBL locus 5 had an additional mutation in MET (N375S) and 2 had an EGFR exon 19 deletion. Twenty-six samples had neither c-CBL mutation nor c-CBL LOH (3 patients had a c-CBL mutation but no c-CBL LOH). Among these 26 samples 9 had a MET mutation (8 N375S, 1 L211W), 13 had an EGFR mutation (7 exon 9 deletion, 6 L858R) and 4 had no other MET or EGFR mutation. Thus the rate of MET or EGFR mutations among patients with LOH at the c-CBL locus (7 of 8) was similar to that seen in patients without c-CBL mutation or LOH (22 of 26 patients) (pâ€Š=â€Š0.99). These 4 patients with no identifiable mutation in c-CBL, MET or EGFR represented 10.8% of the 37 patients analyzed in the Taiwanese patient cohort. Conversely, 89.2% Taiwanese lung cancer patients have an identifiable mutation in either c-CBL, MET or EGFR or a combination of the three genes (Figure 2). Additionally, we determined p53 and KRAS mutations in these Taiwanese cohorts. Two p53 and 1 KRAS mutation were detected. The single KRAS mutation overlapped with one p53 mutation. This patient also had the EGFR exon 19 deletion but had no c-CBL mutation. The other p53 mutation sample had a c-CBL LOH with concurrent MET N375S mutation. Thus, in the Taiwanese samples analyzed, p53/KRAS mutations and c-CBL mutations were mutually exclusive (data not shown).  Figure 2 Figure 2 c-CBL mutations and relationship to MET and EGFR mutations in lung cancer. Cellular Functions of c-CBL Alterations in the Context of Lung Tumorigenesis  A. E3 activity is intact in the mutant c-CBL proteins To investigate whether the different c-CBL mutations affect the E3 activity, EGFR was chosen as a model substrate for c-CBL E3 function. All of the c-CBL mutants tested enhanced ubiquitination of the activated EGFR similar to the wild-type c-CBL protein. This result demonstrates that the catalytic activity of the c-CBL mutants is not impaired when EGFR was the substrate. (Figure 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Ubiquitination, viability, expression and cell cycle analysis of various c-CBL mutants. B. Effect on lung cancer cell viability The effect of a representative c-CBL mutant from each of the three ethnic backgrounds on lung cancer cell viability in cell lines was determined. S80N/H94Y double mutation, Q249E, and W802* were identified in lung tumor samples obtained from a Caucasian, a Taiwanese and an African-American, respectively. As described in methods, the c-CBL wild-type (WT) and the above three mutants were expressed after cloning them into pAlterMax vector in A549 cells. These cells express relatively low basal levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). Transfection efficiency was comparable between different groups and the number of cells transfected with c-CBL wild-type construct was about 70% compared to control cells that were transfected with the empty vector. Cells transfected with S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* c-CBL mutant constructs resulted in increased number of viable cells that was 132.3%, 120.8% and 147.9% higher respectively, relative to the empty vector control transfected cells and significantly different from the wild-type construct (pâ€Š=â€Š0.022, pâ€Š=â€Š0.049, and pâ€Š=â€Š0.008, respectively) (Figure 3B). Relative levels of c-CBL protein in whole cell lysates prepared from samples obtained from a parallel experiment was determined. The c-CBL protein levels in samples representing untransfected and empty vector transfected cells were comparable and those representing the c-CBL WT and the three c-CBL mutants were comparable (Figure 3C).  C. Effect on cell cycle To investigate if the increases in cell viability in different c-CBL mutants are due to increased cellular proliferation, a cell cycle analysis was performed. A549 cells were transfected with the c-CBL WT or the three different mutants: S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*. The empty vector transfectant was used as a control. Forty-eight hours after transfection cell cycle analysis was performed as described in materials and methods. There was no significant change in the subG1, G1 or the S phase of the cell cycle among the different mutants compared to the WT construct (pâ€Š=â€Š0.64, pâ€Š=â€Š0.40, and pâ€Š=â€Š0.28, respectively). The G2/M phase of the cell cycle showed an increase in cell numbers for the three mutants, S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*, when compared to the WT but again the difference was not statistically significant (pâ€Š=â€Š0.25) (Figure 3D).  D. Effect on cell motility To investigate the effect of the expression of the above three c-CBL mutants on cell migration, we carried out wound healing assay as described in materials and methods. The closing of the scratch or the wound was monitored at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. (Figure 4A). In all the samples, that represented cells transfected with mutants, the wound gap was much smaller than that seen in the sample that represented cells transfected with c-CBL WT (p&amp;lt;0.001). We also determined the rate of wound closure for all the five groups. At 48 h, wild-type c-CBL transfectants showed 61.1% open wound while the S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* mutants showed 18.7%, 23.9% and 34.3% open wound respectively (p&amp;lt;0.001) (Figure 4B).  Figure 4 Figure 4 c-CBL mutations affect wound healing in A549 cells. E. c-CBL knockdown increases cell viability It is hypothesized that the LOH seen in our samples could lead to decreased expression of c-CBL. Thus we tested the effect of c-CBL knockdown in lung cancer cells. Compared to A549, H358 lung cancer cells express relatively high levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). c-CBL expression was knocked down using lentiviral construct that expressed c-CBL specific shRNA and compared the results with those that were transduced with scrambled shRNA and the results are shown in Figure 5. We identified several clones that revealed varying degrees of c-CBL knockdown showing different sets of c-CBL lentiviral shRNA knockdown efficiency (Figure 5A). Of all the clones tested, Clone 27 was chosen for further experiments. Equal amount of cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and the cell proliferation was measured at various times and the results are depicted in Figure 5B. As expected, number of cells increased in a time dependent fashion from 100 to 190% relative to scrambled shRNA as control in a span of 48 h (pâ€Š=â€Š0.0002) (Figure 5B). The cell cycle phases in H358 cells that were knocked down with c-CBL shRNA were looked at and compared with the scrambled shRNA. There were no discernable differences between these two constructs in the different phases of the cell cycle (data not shown).  Figure 5 Figure 5 Knockdown of c-CBL using an shRNA increases cell proliferation. Go to: Discussion Our results demonstrate that c-CBL is somatically mutated (or has LOH) in lung cancers, and can significantly contribute to enhanced cell viability and motility. There was also a high prevalence of LOH with respect to c-CBL in lung tumors that harbored MET or EGFR mutation.  In the present study, we have demonstrated the occurrence of c-CBL mutations in lung cancer patients, especially with different ancestral variations. Mutations in c-CBL have been recently reported in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and myeloid malignancies. In the AML study, the mutation R420Q located in the junction of the RING finger and the linker region inhibited FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20], thus contributing to the gain-in-function for the RTK. In addition, mutations such as H398Y, C384R, and L380P mapped to the RING finger domain and the linker region of c-CBL that is required for its E3 activity [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Additionally, homozygous mutations in the RING finger domain of the c-CBL gene were described as a result of acquired Uniparental Disomy (UPD) [26]. It is important to note that our results indicate LOH at 11q23 locus and these are mutually exclusive from missense mutations of c-CBL. The somatic mutations were all heterozygous. The mutations in AML led to abrogation of the E3 activity leading to prolonged RTK activation. In addition mutants located on the linker region surrounding the RING finger domain exhibited enhanced AKT signaling in response to cytokine stimulation [26]. In addition, it was shown in NH3T3 cells, that neither mutations in the RING finger nor the linker region causes transformation, however while certain mutations perturbs the ubiquitination, others affect receptor recycling and prolong kinase activity [28].  We report here c-CBL mutations that mapped not only to the RING finger domain, but also to the TKB domain, proline-rich domain and the C-terminal region, but none mapped to the linker region as reported in the AML studies described above [23], [24], [25], [26], [29]. In addition, 8 mutants that we detected were found in different ethnic backgrounds. For example, S80N/H94Y, Q249E, W802* were detected in Caucasians, Taiwanese and African-Americans, respectively. The results point out not only the difference between lung cancer and other cancers, but also genetic polymorphism among different races in the same cancer. Interestingly, there is a large disparity between African-American and other ethnic populations with lung cancer [30]. We have previously shown that there was a low frequency of EGFR and MET mutation in African-Americans as compared with Taiwanese and Caucasians [31]. In this study, the number of African-American samples analyzed was relatively fewer and we found 3 mutations that are unique to this ethnicity. It would now behoove us to further study the genetic alterations that can occur and determine the targeted therapeutics for African-Americans. Our results provide evidence of the importance of c-CBL in tumorigenesis and potential signaling. Our prediction, based on the AML data, would be that the V391I RING finger domain mutation would affect the E3 activity. Also, it will be important to determine the binding partners for c-CBL in the TKB domain and proline rich domain mutations. It has previously been shown that the TKB domain can bind to growth factor receptors and it will be important to determine the cross-binding of these mutants to MET and or EGFR. It would also be important in the future to look at fluorescence in situ hybridization/copy number changes in c-CBL in lung cancer.  c-CBL plays an important role in down regulating RTK-mediated signaling through K63 poly-ubiquitination and subsequent downregulation of RTKs followed by lysosomal degredation [3]. Mono-ubiquitination or ubiquitinated with K63-linked chains of substrates by c-CBL may lead to enhancement of biological and biochemical functions (reviewed in Hermann et al, 2007 [32]). The mutations that we analyzed in our studies all point out to the fact that the E3 activity of c-CBL on EGFR is intact; the EGFR levels in the various mutants remain same (Figure S2). Multiple kinases, both RTKs and non-RTKs could be acted upon by c-CBL, including ERBs, PDGFR, FMS, MET, c-Kit, VEGFR, FLT-1, RON, FGFR, IR, as well as SYK, FYN, LCK, FGR, LYN and c-ABL [3]. In lung cancers the relevant substrates of c-CBL in terms of degradation or signal transduction are yet to be identified.  The observation that c-CBL somatic mutations, especially S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* showed increased cell viability and cell motility that is in agreement with the physiological role for D-cbl in the regulation of apoptosis and differentiation identified in Drosophila is very significant [33]. It has been previously shown that activating c-CBL mutation downregulates EGFR signaling and decreases cellular proliferation and migration in breast cancer cell lines [34]. Although the role of c-CBL in the negative regulation of RTKs is well substantiated, thereby suggesting that it is a natural tumor suppressor, studies in cancer cells have revealed both tumor suppressor and tumor promoting activities depending on the type of c-CBL mutation and the number of alleles at the c-CBL locus [24]. In agreement with the above, the three c-CBL mutants described here appear to have tumor growth and metastasis promoting properties. Although these mutants are outside of the RING finger or the linker region of c-CBL, their downstream effects are significant so as to cause increased proliferation and migration, but the substrate affected by these mutations are not known yet. This raises the possibility that some of the cellular functions of c-CBL are independent of its ubiquitin-ligase activity, an area that we are currently investigating. The oncogenic nature of RTKs, addiction of cancers to growth signals and given the clustering of c-CBL, EGFR and MET mutations, it is possible that the transforming effect of c-CBL mutations is most likely a combinatorial effect of the three. We also show that LOH for c-CBL was found in a significant number of samples that harbored MET or EGFR mutations. The fact that about 7% of lung tumor samples are likely to have c-CBL mutations and an additional 22% are likely to harbor c-CBL-related LOH, makes c-CBL a highly mutated molecule in lung cancer. Since LOH alone is not enough to cause a transforming event [35], [36], [37], associated mutation in the MET or EGFR locus or yet another RTK discussed above may play a role in carcinogenesis. We predict that this LOH in c-CBL results in haploinsufficiency that downplays RTK ubiquitination leading to hyperactivity of the RTKs. However, whether this is sufficient cause for tumorigenesis remains to be determined. Consistent with our hypothesis is the fact that c-cbl-/- mice have increased kinase activity in lymphocytes, but is not sufficient for tumor formation [35], [36], [37]. c-CBL LOH could also lead to increased expression of c-CBL from the other allele to compensate for a loss of an allele. Alternately, there could be some form of synergy working with reduced c-CBL levels and mutated receptors that exacerbate the phenotype of each alone.  Previous studies from our lab and others have shown that East Asians with lung cancers have relatively high frequencies of gain-of-function of mutations in RTKs such as EGFR and MET [31]. In a cohort of Japanese patients an activating MET mutation was identified in the splice region that deletes the juxtamembrane domain that is involved E3 activity of c-CBL [38]. This study also found that activation of MET is mutually exclusive of EGFR, KRAS and HER2 gene mutations [38]. We failed to detect such mutations in significant numbers in lung tumor samples obtained from African-Americans (nâ€Š=â€Š29) and Caucasian (nâ€Š=â€Š50) patients. One MET mutation was identified in each of the groups whereas 1 and 3 EGFR mutations were identified in the African-American and Caucasian cohorts respectively. EGFR mutations have earlier been identified as one of the key mutations affecting lung adenocarcinoma patients in a comprehensive study of 188 patients [39]. Our study encompasses different histologies of NSCLC. However, the published series did not find any mutations in c-CBL or MET unlike our study that encompassed different subtypes of NSCLC. It is important to note, we have recently shown that MET mutations in lung cancer are in majority germline [31]. We have reported earlier c-CBL mutations in a small cohort of Taiwanese lung cancer samples [40]. In our efforts to understand the ethnic differences in the lung oncogenome, we also looked at PAX transcription factors such as PAX5 and PAX8 that are highly expressed in lung cancers; however there was no preferential expression or mutations of the above genes in lung tumor samples of African-Americans. In this study, we show relatively high frequency of c-CBL mutations in lung cancers, especially in the large cell type among Caucasians and particularly among African-Americans. We therefore propose c-CBL as an efficacious target for lung cancers in African-Americans that needs to be further substantiated. This is all the more important because the prognosis for African-Americans with lung cancer, especially for men is much poorer compared to their Caucasian counterparts [41].  In conclusion, the results presented in this study demonstrate that c-CBL is frequently mutated or even lost in lung cancers. Our results support a role for c-CBL mutants that are independent of its ubiquitination activity. Given the relatively high mutation rates in c-CBL as well as RTKs such as MET and EGFR, it is likely that their combined effect could be synergistic in promoting tumorigenesis.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;Recent evidence has demonstrated that acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) is a novel mechanism by which pathogenetic mutations in cancer may be reduced to homozygosity. To help identify novel mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), we performed a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screen to identify aUPD in 58 patients with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML; n = 30), JAK2 mutationâ€“negative myelofibrosis (MF; n = 18), or JAK2 mutationâ€“negative polycythemia vera (PV; n = 10). Stretches of homozygous, copy neutral SNP calls greater than 20Mb were seen in 10 (33%) aCML and 1 (6%) MF, but were absent in PV. In total, 7 different chromosomes were involved with 7q and 11q each affected in 10% of aCML cases. CBL mutations were identified in all 3 cases with 11q aUPD and analysis of 574 additional MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients with aCML, myelofibrosis or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Most variants were missense substitutions in the RING or linker domains that abrogated CBL ubiquitin ligase activity and conferred a proliferative advantage to 32D cells overexpressing FLT3. We conclude that acquired, transforming CBL mutations are a novel and widespread pathogenetic abnormality in morphologically related, clinically aggressive MPNs.  Introduction  Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by overproliferation of one or more myeloid cell lineages in the bone marrow and increased numbers of mature and immature myeloid cells in the peripheral blood. Excess proliferation is frequently associated with splenomegaly and cardiovascular complications as well as increased risk of transformation to acute leukemia. MPNs are categorized into subtypes based on specific morphologic, hematologic, and laboratory parameters, the best characterized being the 4 so-called classic MPNs: polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (MF), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).1 In addition, several atypical MPNs are recognized, some of which show both dysplastic and proliferative features, such as atypical, BCR-ABL negative CML (aCML).2  MPNs are associated with acquired, activating mutations or gene fusions of tyrosine kinases, abnormalities that are believed to be critical drivers of excess proliferation as a result of deregulated or constitutive signaling.3 The 2 most prominent examples are BCR-ABL in CML4 and the V617F JAK2 mutation in PV, ET, and MF,5â‡“â‡“â€“8 but more than 40 variant tyrosine kinase fusions have been identified in MPNs as well as other mutations in JAK2 and FLT3.2 Activating mutations have been described in components that signal upstream (eg, MPL) or downstream (eg, NRAS) of tyrosine kinases9,10; however, the molecular pathogenesis of the majority of atypical MPNs and approximately 50% of ET and MF cases remains obscure.  V617F JAK2 was initially identified by several different routes, one of which was based on the observation that many PV patients show evidence of acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) at chromosome 9p.11,12 Regions of aUPD exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) compared with constitutional DNA without change of copy number and arise by mitotic recombination followed by selection for one of the products. After the initial observations in PV, it has emerged that aUPD is common in both hematologic and epithelial malignancies, and is associated with known oncogenic changes in a variety of genes within the affected regions.13 In this study we set out to determine whether aUPD characterizes MPNs of unknown molecular etiology and, if so, whether it could be used as a tool to help identify novel driver mutations.  Methods  Patients  Peripheral blood or bone marrow samples were received from patients diagnosed with an MPN or other hematologic malignancy according to standard morphologic, hematologic, and laboratory criteria. Clinical data were available from a subset of these cases. The study was approved by the Internal Review Boards from participating institutions and informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  SNP array analysis  DNA labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix 50k XbaI chips was performed at the Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum fÃ¼r Genomforschung (RZPD, Berlin, Germany). Raw data were imported into the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software, analyzed using Affymetrix (High Wycombe, United Kingdom) GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE 4.1) and copy number analysis tool (CNAT). Data were exported to custom-designed spreadsheets that display loss of heterozygosity and copy number changes in ideogram format. Data were also analyzed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console (version 2.1). Overall, a median of 98.2% (range, 91.5%-99.6%) of SNPs gave readable calls.  Mutation analysis  Detection of mutations by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis was performed as described14 using a Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Sciences, St Neots, United Kingdom). Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products was performed by standard techniques on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, United Kingdom) and analyzed using Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics, State College, PA). CBL mutations are numbered relative to the ATG (A = 1) in the Ensembl cDNA sequence ENSG00000110395. A dropping factor (relative intensity drop of the wild-type allele peak relative to that seen in a concurrently run normal sample) of 60% or more was considered indicative of a biallelic mutation whereas a dropping factor of less than 60% was considered as monoallelic. Primer sequences for CBL exon 8 were CBL_i7f (5â€²-tgtggtttcactttaaaccctgga-3â€²) and CBL_i8r (5â€²-gccaggccaccccttgtatc-3â€²) and for CBL exon 9 were CBL_i8f (5â€²-ggcctggcttttgggttagg-3â€²) and CBL_i9r (5â€²-cacaatggattttgccagtctcc-3â€²). CBL reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was performed on random hexamerâ€“reverse transcribed RNA using primers CBLe7F: 5â€²-gaatcctgatctgactggcttatg-3â€² and CBLe10R 5â€²-gctgcggcagaaggtcaagt-3â€². Other primer sequences are available on request.  Microsatellite analysis  DNA samples were amplified with a series of fluorescently labeled primer pairs flanking highly polymorphic microsatellite markers on chromosome 11q as described.10 aUPD was scored if 4 or more consecutive markers encompassing CBL were homozygous without change in allelic copy number (P &amp;lt; .05 of this occurring in the absence of aUPD based on published rates of heterozygosity). Copy number at 11q was estimated by multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) using the Marfan probeset 1 (P065; MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), a kit that contains four 11q control probes including one at 11q23.3.  Constructs  pMY-wtCBL and pMY-CBLR420Q express wild-type and R420Q CBL, respectively, along with green fluorescent protein (GFP).15 Other CBL mutant constructs were derived from pMY-wtCBL using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pAL/FLT3 and pCMVâ€“HA ubiquitin have also been described previously.15  Cell lines  The IL-3â€“dependent murine myeloid cell 32Dcl3 (32D) was purchased from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (Braunschweig, Germany) and was maintained in 90% RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium (WEHI). All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37Â°C and 5% carbon dioxide. 32D cells were stably transduced by electroporation with wt-FLT3 in a pAL vector as previously described16 and maintained in 15 ng/mL blastocidin (Invitrogen, Paisley United Kingdom). The Platinum-E (Plat-E) retrovirus packaging cell line17 was transfected using the calcium phosphate method with 5 Î¼g CBL construct DNA: 106 32D/wtFLT3 cells were cocultivated with the Plat-E cells for 48 hours in a volume of 2 mL (50% RPMI, 50% DMEM, 10% FBS, 5% WEHI). GFP positive cells were flow sorted to highest possible purity using a BD FACSAria cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, Stanford, CA). If insufficient cells were obtained for experiments after flow sorting, the cells were maintained in culture and resorted to greater than 95% purity.  Growth factor withdrawal assays  Cell growth was compared with wt-FLT3, vector-only transfected cells and the parental 32D line in stably transfected cells. Cells (105/mL) were grown over 3 days in triplicate for each CBL mutant and a wt-CBL control in 96-well plates. Cultures were analyzed daily for proliferation using the Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (MTS assay; Promega, Southampton, United Kingdom). All experiments were performed at least 3 times independently and results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).  Ubiquitin ligase activity  The ubiquitin ligase activity of CBL mutants in comparison to wild-type CBL was determined by transiently transfecting 107 32D/wtFLT3 cells expressing wild-type or CBL mutants by electroporation with 20 Î¼g pCMV-HA ubiquitin. Cells were maintained in culture with WEHI for 12 hours after transfection before being washed, serum deprived overnight, exposed to FLT3 ligand for 10 minutes, and lysed in buffer as described.18 Lysates were incubated with a FLT3-specific polyclonal antibody overnight at 4Â°C. Protein G agarose beads (100 Î¼L) were added and incubated at 4Â°C for 4 hours. The beads were washed 4 times in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer. The supernatant was mixed with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sample loading buffer before immunoblot analyses with antibodies against HA-ubiquitin (sc-805; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), CBL (2111C3a; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), and FLT3 (sc-479; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA).  Results  SNP array analysis  We performed genome-wide SNP analysis on leukocyte DNA extracted from 58 MPD patients: aCML (n = 30), V617F JAK2 negative MF (n = 18), and JAK2 mutation negative PV/idiopathic erythrocytosis (n = 10). As comparators, we also analyzed cases of CML in transformation to blast crisis (n = 30, of which 20 were myeloid and 10 lymphoid) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n = 20). We conservatively defined likely regions of aUPD as at least 20 Mb of absent or significantly reduced heterozygous SNP calls (ie, &amp;lt; 5% SNPs called as heterozygous) running to a telomere without change in copy number (Figure 1A). Such large regions are uncommon in healthy individuals.19 Strikingly, we found that aUPD was common in aCML with 10 (33%) of cases affected. In contrast, aUPD was only seen in a single case of MF and was not seen in other patient subgroups. In total, 7 different chromosomes were affected, with abnormalities at 7q and 11q each seen recurrently in 10% of aCML cases. The affected regions ranged in size from 29 Mb to a complete copy of chromosome 13 (Table 1).

The x-axis for the CN plots show (copy number)âˆ’2 as determined by CNAT, with values approaching or exceeding âˆ’1 indicating deletions and greater than +1 indicating amplifications.

There is no gross copy number change (individual datapoints spread around the zero line), but a large block of homozygous SNP calls at 9p indicative of aUPD. The 2 panels on the right are from a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis case and show LOH accompanied by a 20q deletion. (B) For case UPN 5, a large block of 11q aUPD is apparent on analysis of granulocytes but almost completely absent from mononuclear cells (MNCs) extracted from the same sample.

Two controls are shown: an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient previously known to have a heterozygous FLT3 ITD and a healthy individual. View inlineView popup Table 1 Chromosomal regions and cases affected by aUPD Association between aUPD and known acquired oncogenic mutations  Although we did not have constitutional DNA to formally confirm that the regions of homozygosity were acquired, in 1 individual we found a marked reduction in the proportion of 11q aUPD positive cells on comparison of mononuclear cells and granulocytes, consistent with an acquired abnormality (Figure 1B). Some of the affected regions harbor genes known to be relevant to hematologic malignancies and therefore we assessed their mutational status. Sequencing of the MPL gene in the case UPN 27 with 1p aUPD revealed a homozygous G&amp;gt;T change (Figure 1C) that results in the previously reported W515L substitution.9 Case UPN 28 with whole chromosome 13 UPD had a homozygous FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD; Figure 1D). Candidate genes for the abnormalities at 17q and 21q include NF1 and RUNX1, respectively; however, these were not investigated.  11q aUPD is associated with CBL mutations  Next, we focused our analysis on the 2 recurrent regions of aUPD at 7q and 11q. Because of the strong association between MPNs and aberrant tyrosine kinase signaling, we analyzed genes encoding tyrosine kinases and associated signaling components. The minimally affected region at chromosome 7q contains 3 tyrosine kinases: MET, EPHA1, and EPHB6. We fully sequenced the coding exons of these genes in the 3 cases with 7q aUPD and 2 normal controls but found no abnormalities. Similarly, we found no sequence changes in exons 11 through 17 of BRAF, a gene encoding a downstream component of RAS signaling that is mutated in malignant melanoma and other cancers.20 There are no tyrosine kinase genes on chromosome 11q, and although there are several genes encoding signal transduction components, CBL stood out as a known oncogene that negatively regulates tyrosine kinase signaling.21 Sequencing of CBL in the three 11q aUPD cases revealed that UPN 2 and UPN 5 each had a T&amp;gt;C change at nucleotide 1277 in exon 8 that predicts a L380P substitution. Case UPN 3 had a C&amp;gt;G missense change in exon 9 at nucleotide 1387 that predicts a P417A change (Figure 2). Consistent with the array results, the mutations in cases UPN 3 and UPN 5 were predominant with the residual wild-type alleles only weakly visible. For case UPN 2 both the mutation and level of aUPD was less prominent, presumably due to a greater background of normal cells.

Prevalence and nature of CBL mutations  To determine the prevalence of CBL mutations, we sequenced exons 8 and 9 (that encode amino acids 366 through 409 and 410 through 477, respectively) in an additional 574 MPN cases. A total of 27 sequence variants were identified in 26 patients, of whom 3 had MF, 10 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), 12 had aCML and 1 had hypereosinophilic syndrome/chronic eosinophilic leukemia (HES/CEL; Tables 2 and 3). To ensure that we were not missing mutations elsewhere in the gene we analyzed all coding exons in 70 CBL mutation negative aCML or unclassified, CML-like MPN cases by high resolution melt (HRM) analysis but failed to detect any further sequence changes apart from known polymorphisms. Similarly, no mutations in CBLB exons 9 or 10 or CBLC exons 7 and 8 (the exons that correspond to CBL exons 8 and 9) were identified. The activity of BCR-ABL is known to increase during progression of CML from chronic phase to blast crisis22 and we speculated that abrogation of CBL activity might be at least partially responsible for this increase. HRM analysis of CBL exons 8 and 9 in blast crisis cases (n = 31), however, failed to reveal any mutations.  View inlineView popup Table 2 Cases analyzed for CBL mutations View inlineView popup Table 3 List of CBL sequence variants Of the 27 CBL variants, 21 (78%) were missense substitutions affecting 12 amino acids (15 different substitutions), 5 (19%) were candidate splicing abnormalities, and 1 (3%) produced a stop codon (Table 3). Most of the changes were novel, although 4 cases had R420Q as previously identified in a single case of AML.15 Apart from N454D, all residues affected by missense mutations were completely conserved in CBL orthologues as well as the 2 other human CBL family members (Figure 3). The mutation to a stop codon was found in a patient (UPN 9) who also had the Y371H variant; PCR across the affected regions and sequencing indicated that the 2 changes were on different alleles.

Residues affected by missense mutations found in this study are indicated by â–¼. CBL mutations are acquired and rarely seen in conjunction with other known mutations  For 2 cases (UPN 5 and UPN 14) we were able to compare the mutational status of leukocytes and T cells or buccal epithelia cells. In both cases the L380P mutation was only present in leukocytes and was therefore acquired (Figure 4A). A third case (UPN 15) originally presented with V617F JAK2 negative ET in 1989 but progressed to MF in 2004. Analysis of DNA extracted from sequential bone marrow slides indicated that the R420Q mutation was absent at the ET phase but acquired on transformation (Figure 4B). The 3 CBL-positive MF cases tested negative for MPL 515 mutations and all CBL mutation positive cases were negative for cytogenetic indicators of tyrosine kinase fusions, FLT3 ITD, activating NRAS mutations and V617F JAK2, with the exception of 1 case (UPN 14) with MF who tested positive for both L380P CBL and V617F JAK2. Analysis of retrospective bone marrow slides for this case indicated the presence of V617F JAK2 at low level initially but absence of L380P CBL. The CBL mutation was detectable 7 years later and completely displaced V617F after a further 3 years, corresponding with a significant rise is peripheral leukocyte counts (Figure 4C). A further case (UPN 21) presented with systemic mastocytosis before evolving to CBL mutation-positive CMML but retrospective samples were unavailable.

(C) Clinical course of case UPN 14, who presented with MF in 1998 but experienced elevated leukocyte counts in 2005, concomitant with the appearance of the CBL L380P mutation. The JAK2 V617F mutation, which had been present at low level since diagnosis, was still detectable when CBL L380P first appeared but was undetectable in the 2008 sample, when the CBL mutated clone predominated (* on sequence trace). (D) RT-PCR analysis. All cases and controls show the expected product from CBL exons 7-10. Cases UPN 18 and UPN 20 show smaller bands that result from complete deletion of exon 8. Splicing abnormalities  RNA was available for 3 of the 5 cases with potential splicing mutations. Patients UPN 18 and UPN 20 both exhibited double bands by RT-PCR, sequencing of which showed one to be the normal product and the smaller band to result from the complete deletion of exon 8 in each case (Figure 4D), similar to that described in the cell line MOLM-13.23 Patient UPN 19 showed a single band by RT-PCR that was entirely normal on sequence analysis indicating that the exon 8+4 C&amp;gt;T change does not alter splicing. It seems likely, therefore, that the variant identified in case UPN 6 is also of no consequence. The pathogenicity of the intronic variant seen in case UPN 13 remains unknown.  The association between CBL mutations and UPD  To examine the association between CBL mutations and aUPD in more detail we performed microsatellite analysis on all mutated cases using 9 polymorphic markers spanning chromosome 11q13-qter. Of the 26 cases, 11 displayed patterns that indicated significant tracts of homozygosity, including all 3 with 11q aUPD detected by SNP arrays. Case UPN 9 with 2 mutations was heterozygous for all markers. Of the 11 cases with biallelic CBL mutations as judged by sequence analysis, 5 showed complete homozygosity at all microsatellite loci tested and 6 had at least 4 consecutive homozygous calls encompassing the location of the CBL gene at 11q23.3 (Figure 5). We performed multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) analysis to determine whether the observed homozygosity was a consequence of a deletion but no copy number changes were detected (data not shown) and therefore it is likely that homozygosity arose by aUPD. The number of mutated alleles estimated by sequencing was concordant with the microsatellite analysis in 20 cases (Figure 5). Of those that were discordant, UPN 6 and UPN 25 had significant tracts of 11q homozygosity but had a monoallelic CBL mutation whereas UPN 10 and UPN 16 did not show 11q homozygosity but had clear biallelic CBL mutations. The reason for these discrepant cases is unclear, but it is possible that the aUPD seen in UPN 6 and UPN 25 targeted another gene at 11q before acquisition of the CBL mutation. Homozygosity for the CBL mutations in the absence of 11q aUPD in UPN 10 and UPN 16 might be explained by a subcytogenetic deletion of 1 allele.  Figure 5 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 5 Microsatellite analysis of CBL mutation positive cases. The number of CBL mutated alleles (1 monoallelic; 2 biallelic) was estimated by sequence analysis as described in â€œExperimental procedures.â€� Microsatellites were scored as homozygous (Embedded Image) or heterozygous (â–¡) for each case and their positions on chromosome 11q are indicated. Correlation between CBL mutations and clinical features  We compared clinical and hematologic features in patients with or without CBL mutations, restricting the analysis to cases with aCML, MF and CMML because these were the subgroups in which CBL mutations were most commonly found. Patients with CBL mutations had a shorter overall survival and progression-free survival compared with mutation negative cases (overall survival: 33 months vs 39 months; progression-free survival: 22 months vs 32 months) but the differences were not significant (Figure 6). Similarly there was no significant difference in gender distribution, age and standard hematologic parameters between mutation positive and mutation negative cases and no differences emerged when individual disease entities were considered.

Overall survival (A) and progression-free survival (B) for atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and MF cases with (n = 19) or without (n = 87) CBL mutations. The differences between mutation positive and negative cases was not significant as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Transforming activities of CBL mutants  We determined whether selected CBL variants had oncogenic activity by testing whether they could transform the interleukin-3 (IL-3)â€“dependent cell line 32D to growth factor independence in conjunction with overexpression of wild-type FLT3, as has been described previously for R420Q.15 We found that S376F, H398Y, P417A, and R420Q alone each conferred a degree of growth factor independence to 32D cells, but this effect was considerably enhanced in 32Ds that overexpressed wild-type FLT3. In contrast, wild-type CBL conferred no growth advantage either with or without FLT3 overexpression. The N454D change was not transforming, indicating that it is probably a rare polymorphism or a pathogenetically unimportant passenger mutation (Figure 7). Reproducible differences in survival between the different mutants were seen, as illustrated in Figure 8A.  Figure 7 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 7 Transforming activity of CBL mutants. 32D cells or 32Ds overexpressing wild-type FLT3 were transfected with wild-type or mutant CBL constructs and assayed for IL-3 independent growth over 3 days.

(B) 32D cells expressing wild-type FLT3 and CBL constructs as indicated were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and stimulated with FLT3 ligand. After lysis, FLT3 was immunoprecipitated, blotted, and probed with anti-HA. Total blots for FLT3 AND CBL are also shown. Abrogation of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity  It has been shown that FLT3 physically associates with CBL and that, upon ligand stimulation, FLT3 is rapidly ubiquitinylated by wild-type but not R420Q CBL.15 We found that transforming activity correlated directly with the ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL variants, as assayed by their ability to transfer HA-tagged ubiquitin to FLT3 after stimulation with FLT3 ligand. The S376F, H398Y, P417A and R420Q mutants showed loss of ubiquitin ligase activity, whereas N454D was comparable to wild-type CBL (Figure 8B).  Discussion  The initial aim of our study was to identify large regions of aUPD and therefore we undertook a relatively low resolution genome scan using 50k SNP arrays. Because we did not have constitutional DNA available from most of our cases, we were not able to unambiguously determine whether the extended blocks of homozygosity that we observed were a consequence of aUPD, constitutional UPD or autozygosity due to consaguinity, however we used a very conservative definition of candidate aUPD regions (at least 20 Mb homozygous SNPs calls running to a telomere) and therefore expected that most or all would be acquired. We found that aUPD was relatively common in aCML, but was uncommon in other MPNs that were negative for known mutations, plus also CML blast crisis and CLL. Six distinct regions of aUPD were identified in aCML, indicating substantial genetic heterogeneity in the genesis of this disorder. However, we identified 2 recurrent regions of aUPD at 7q and 11q that were each seen in 10% of cases indicating the presence of common molecular abnormalities.  Our mutation screening focused primarily on tyrosine kinases and associated signal transduction components because of the known association between deregulated tyrosine kinase signaling and MPNs.3 Although we failed thus far to identify any abnormality on chromosome 7q, we found missense CBL mutations in all three 11q aUPD cases. Screening of further MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients who had been diagnosed with aCML (n = 12; 8%), MF (n = 3, 6%), CMML (n = 10, 13%), or HES/CEL (n = 1, 1%); that is, morphologically and clinically related diseases that generally exhibit a poor prognosis. We were unable to discern, however, any specific clinical or prognostic features specifically associated with CBL mutated cases.  Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL) is a well characterized protein that plays both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling. In its positive role, CBL binds to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via its N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain and serves as an adaptor by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K. However the RING domain of CBL has E3 ligase activity and ubiquitinylates activated receptor tyrosine kinases on lysine residues, a signal that triggers internalization of the receptor/ligand complex and subsequent recycling or degradation.21,24,25 CBL was originally identified after the characterization of v-Cbl, the transforming component of the Cas NS-1 retrovirus, and thus its association with neoplasia is well established26; however, it is only very recently that CBL mutations were first identified in a human malignancy, specifically occasional cases of AML.15,23,27 We have found that CBL mutations are much more common in MPNs, and previous reports of 11q aUPD in MDS28 suggest that CBL mutations will also prove to be common in this disease. Indeed, 7 of 12 MDS cases with aUPD at 11q were recently shown to harbor CBL mutations.29 There are 2 other human CBL family members, CBLB and CBLC, but we did not identify aUPD in the regions containing these genes and did not detect any mutations of the linker/RING domain of CBLB.  We identified a total of 15 different CBL missense mutations affecting 12 residues (Table 2; Figure 3). Mutations of some of these residues (eg, Y371, C381, H398 and W408) have been analyzed previously in a study that concluded that loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and concomitant impairment of EGFR internalization by RING finger mutations was insufficient for oncogenicity, as assayed in NIH3T3 cells. However mutations of key residues within the Î±-helix of the linker region abolished ubiquitin ligase activity and were transforming.30 Although the precise amino acid substitutions we identified were different from those studied, we found that mutations in both the RING finger and linker regions conferred autonomous growth to 32D/wt-FLT3 cells, consistent with a causal relationship to the MPN phenotype. The fact that one mutation (N454D) was not transforming emphasizes the importance of functional analysis to distinguish driver mutations from irrelevant passengers or infrequent polymorphisms.31 Notably, this mutation was only weakly conserved between species, in contrast to all other missense mutations that affected highly conserved residues and are therefore likely to be functionally significant.  Enhanced autonomous growth in the presence of CBL mutations and overexpression of wild-type FLT3 may simply reflect the paucity of receptor tyrosine kinase gene expression in 32D cells or, alternatively, may indicate that the mutants are only weakly transforming and require the cooperation of other events to give rise to clinically manifest disease. Consistent with the latter hypothesis, we identified 2 cases in which CBL mutations were acquired during progression of a preexisting MPN (Figure 4). In both cases the identity of the cooperating change is unknown: although one presented with a (relatively low level) V617F JAK2 mutation, this disappeared on progression to CBL L380P positive disease, indicating that the 2 mutations must have arisen independently in different clones. This is reminiscent of the observation that the leukemic blasts of approximately half of V617F positive MPNs that evolve to AML are negative for the JAK2 mutation.32,33 It remains to be established, however, if CBL mutations are usually secondary events or whether the 2 cases we identified are exceptional.  Further evidence for the requirement for additional cooperating genetic events comes from published mouse studies in which neither complete CBL knockout nor heterozygous knockin of the RING finger inactivating mutant C379A (mouse C379 is equivalent to human C381) resulted in evidence of an MPN or other malignancy.34,35 However, closer analysis revealed subtle hemopoietic perturbations that clearly relate to the pathogenesis of MPNs. Specifically, hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from these animals were increased in number, hyperresponsive to thrombopoietin and more potent than wild-type HSCs in repopulating the hemopoietic system. These effects were associated with increased STAT5 accumulation and phosphorylation.34,35 Hyperresponsiveness to growth factors and stem cell involvement are 2 of the cardinal features of MPNs. Furthermore, the association between STAT5 activation and MPNs is well documented.36,37 While it is possible that overt hematologic disease might have been induced by a homozygous knockin mutant, these findings suggest that CBL mutations may not be solely responsible for a full MPN phenotype.  The nature of any cooperating abnormalities remains largely obscure. Our results show that overexpression of a tyrosine kinase can cooperate with CBL mutants to promote transformation, however we failed to identify any kinase that was consistently overexpressed in mutation positive cases by tyrosine kinase expression profiling (data not shown). One CBL mutation positive case, however, also tested positive for 7q UPD by SNP array, suggesting that these 2 abnormalities may complement each other. A CBL mutation resulting in skipping of exon 8 has also been identified in a murine model of NUP98-HOXD13 on progression from MDS to AML,38 further corroborating the theory that acute leukemia arises from complementary mutations, one of which inhibits differentiation, and a second (in this case CBL) that enhances proliferation or inhibits apoptosis.  The fact that many CBL mutations are associated with aUPD strongly suggests that clones with homozygous mutations have a selective advantage over those that are heterozygous. This contrasts with the prevailing view that transforming CBL RING finger and linker region mutants act in a dominant negative fashion. Although it is conceivable that another, unknown locus on 11q is the target of aUPD, the finding of 1 case with a Y371H mutation and a stop codon on opposite alleles strongly suggests that homozygous CBL mutations do indeed confer a direct selective advantage. Because we did not screen the entire gene for mutations, it is possible that other cases with heterozygous mutations may also be functionally homozygous due to premature stop codons on the other allele. Alternatively, heterozygosity in these cases may only be apparent due to variable proportions of background normal cells that are not part of the malignant clone. Although the nontransforming N454D mutant was heterozygous, 2 cases with heterozygous R420Q were observed and thus absence of homozygosity cannot be used to infer the presence of an irrelevant, nontransforming sequence variant.  In summary, we have found that oncogenic CBL mutations are acquired in a subset of hematologically related, poor prognosis MPNs. Our findings further strengthen the notion that MPNs are primarily â€œtyrosine kinopathies,â€� that is, diseases caused by aberrant activation of proliferation and survival pathways as a consequence of mutations that either directly or indirectly promote excess tyrosine kinase signaling. In view of the fact that tyrosine kinases are such good drug targets, the possibility that CBL-mutated cases might be amenable to therapeutic inhibition is clearly attractive.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors, but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study, we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability, binding, and activity. We found that recurrent, homozygous, and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2, by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and, to a lesser extent, with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding, whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity, and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL, driver mutations, protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations), the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability, interactions, and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures, their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2, 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity, stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5, 6). Strikingly, proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD), a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain, while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time, since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain, they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9, 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK, CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein, thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study, substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach, which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability, binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely, we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent, homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations), zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations), types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition, all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€� missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures, we obtained 2,102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL), (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S), (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13), CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%, the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40,000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX, respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation, optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27), the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs, described above, were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega, Madison, WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15, A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15, and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp., Madison, WI), incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change, and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins, cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals, Fairlawn, NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO], 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®, Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16,000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). For immunoblotting, 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations, 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer, then resuspended in 2X loading buffer, boiled for 5 m, then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman, Sanford, MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins, the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling), rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase, (clone 3F10; Roche), rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc., South Plainfield, NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc., Long Beach, CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination, in the presence of each CBL mutation, was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes, Î”Î”Gfold, upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35, 36). Namely, the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations, recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1, Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall, the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However, it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger, as we show later, this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single, Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V, G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements, whereas other mutations (S376F, Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example, L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations, especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters, compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01, Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations, therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state, consistent with experiments, we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability, recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B, S1 and Table S2). Importantly, cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next, all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations, Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them, several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example, the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10, 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family, it strongly interacts with the Q92, W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q, R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation, there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€�) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€�) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall, we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B, Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6, 38, 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL, then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele, it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed, human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status, trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples, and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods, Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, in the presence of wild-type CBL, activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type, CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells, predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1), binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R, H398Q, Y371H, K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R, H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand, the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This, in turn, could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover, K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B,C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally, the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V, V430M, P428L, Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this, the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific, we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells, transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this, the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells, the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example, the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas V430M, consistent with experimental data, had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally, the third group constituted mutations (L399V, G375P, P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this, there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly, mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast, the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed, the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5, changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison, several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy, they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52, with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations, (30â€“33, 41) and some of them use structural features (31, 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However, all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5, all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58, Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural, foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand, thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites, which might not be energetically optimal (36, 42). In tumorigenesis, protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level, but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43, 44). However, the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein, here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies, which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation, we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity), while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study, about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity, while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models, we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However, these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed, many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations, but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly, the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene, their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47), where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48, 49). Importantly, all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact, the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state, p-value &amp;lt; 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants, one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However, as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes, this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall, our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity, of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases, of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However, there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1), CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand, as shown in our study and in other studies, cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL, so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies, understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed, targeted therapies. Our approach, which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest, emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors, but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study, we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability, binding, and activity. We found that recurrent, homozygous, and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2, by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and, to a lesser extent, with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding, whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity, and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL, driver mutations, protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations), the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability, interactions, and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures, their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2, 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity, stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5, 6). Strikingly, proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD), a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain, while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time, since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain, they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9, 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK, CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein, thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study, substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach, which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability, binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely, we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent, homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations), zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations), types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition, all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€� missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures, we obtained 2,102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL), (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S), (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13), CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%, the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40,000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX, respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation, optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27), the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs, described above, were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega, Madison, WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15, A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15, and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp., Madison, WI), incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change, and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins, cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals, Fairlawn, NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO], 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®, Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16,000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). For immunoblotting, 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations, 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer, then resuspended in 2X loading buffer, boiled for 5 m, then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman, Sanford, MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins, the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling), rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase, (clone 3F10; Roche), rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc., South Plainfield, NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc., Long Beach, CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination, in the presence of each CBL mutation, was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes, Î”Î”Gfold, upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35, 36). Namely, the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations, recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1, Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall, the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However, it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger, as we show later, this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single, Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V, G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements, whereas other mutations (S376F, Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example, L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations, especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters, compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01, Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations, therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state, consistent with experiments, we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability, recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B, S1 and Table S2). Importantly, cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next, all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations, Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them, several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example, the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10, 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family, it strongly interacts with the Q92, W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q, R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation, there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€�) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€�) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall, we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B, Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6, 38, 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL, then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele, it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed, human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status, trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples, and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods, Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, in the presence of wild-type CBL, activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type, CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells, predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1), binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R, H398Q, Y371H, K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R, H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand, the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This, in turn, could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover, K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B,C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally, the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V, V430M, P428L, Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this, the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific, we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells, transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this, the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells, the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example, the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas V430M, consistent with experimental data, had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally, the third group constituted mutations (L399V, G375P, P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this, there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly, mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast, the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed, the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5, changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison, several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy, they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52, with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations, (30â€“33, 41) and some of them use structural features (31, 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However, all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5, all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58, Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural, foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand, thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites, which might not be energetically optimal (36, 42). In tumorigenesis, protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level, but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43, 44). However, the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein, here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies, which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation, we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity), while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study, about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity, while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models, we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However, these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed, many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations, but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly, the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene, their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47), where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48, 49). Importantly, all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact, the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state, p-value &amp;lt; 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants, one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However, as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes, this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall, our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity, of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases, of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However, there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1), CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand, as shown in our study and in other studies, cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL, so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies, understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed, targeted therapies. Our approach, which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest, emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors, but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study, we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability, binding, and activity. We found that recurrent, homozygous, and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2, by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and, to a lesser extent, with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding, whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity, and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL, driver mutations, protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations), the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability, interactions, and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures, their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2, 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity, stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5, 6). Strikingly, proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD), a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain, while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time, since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain, they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9, 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK, CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein, thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study, substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach, which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability, binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely, we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent, homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations), zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations), types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition, all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€� missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures, we obtained 2,102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL), (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S), (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13), CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%, the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40,000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX, respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation, optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27), the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs, described above, were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega, Madison, WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15, A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15, and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp., Madison, WI), incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change, and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins, cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals, Fairlawn, NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO], 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®, Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16,000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). For immunoblotting, 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations, 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer, then resuspended in 2X loading buffer, boiled for 5 m, then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman, Sanford, MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins, the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling), rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase, (clone 3F10; Roche), rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc., South Plainfield, NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc., Long Beach, CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination, in the presence of each CBL mutation, was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes, Î”Î”Gfold, upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35, 36). Namely, the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations, recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1, Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall, the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However, it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger, as we show later, this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single, Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V, G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements, whereas other mutations (S376F, Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example, L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations, especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters, compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01, Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations, therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state, consistent with experiments, we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability, recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B, S1 and Table S2). Importantly, cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next, all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations, Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them, several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example, the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10, 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family, it strongly interacts with the Q92, W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q, R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation, there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€�) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€�) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall, we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B, Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6, 38, 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL, then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele, it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed, human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status, trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples, and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods, Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, in the presence of wild-type CBL, activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type, CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells, predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1), binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R, H398Q, Y371H, K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R, H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand, the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This, in turn, could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover, K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B,C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally, the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V, V430M, P428L, Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this, the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific, we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells, transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this, the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells, the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example, the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas V430M, consistent with experimental data, had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally, the third group constituted mutations (L399V, G375P, P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this, there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly, mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast, the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed, the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5, changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison, several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy, they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52, with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations, (30â€“33, 41) and some of them use structural features (31, 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However, all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5, all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58, Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural, foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand, thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites, which might not be energetically optimal (36, 42). In tumorigenesis, protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level, but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43, 44). However, the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein, here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies, which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation, we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity), while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study, about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity, while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models, we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However, these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed, many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations, but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly, the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene, their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47), where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48, 49). Importantly, all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact, the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state, p-value &amp;lt; 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants, one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However, as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes, this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall, our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity, of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases, of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However, there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1), CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand, as shown in our study and in other studies, cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL, so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies, understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed, targeted therapies. Our approach, which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest, emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

In this study, we determined the frequency of CBL mutations in acute leukemias and evaluated the oncogenic potential of mutant CBL. Experimental Design: The cDNA of 300 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and 82 human leukemic cell lines was screened for aberrations in the linker and RING finger domain of CBL. The oncogenic potential of identified mutants was evaluated in hematopoietic cells. Results:We identified 3 of 279 AML/MDS patients expressingCBL exon 8/9 deletion mutants. Three of four cases at diagnosis expressed deleted transcripts missing exon 8 or exon 8/9. In remission samples a weak or no expression of mutant CBL was detected. No aberrations were found in normal hematopoietic tissues. One of 116 sequenced AML/MDS cases carried a R420G missense mutation. All AML/MDS patients with identified CBL mutants belonged to the core bindingfactor and 11q deletion AML subtypes. Functionally, CBL negatively regulated FMSlike tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) activity and interacted with human FLT3 via the autophosphorylation sitesY589 andY599 and colocalized in vivo. Expression of CBLDexon8 and CBLDexon8+9 in FLT3-WT-Ba/F3 cells induced growth factor ^ independent proliferation associated with autophosphorylation of FLT3 and activated the downstream targets signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and protein kinase B (AKT). FLT3 ligand ^ dependent hyperproliferation of CBL mutant cells could be abrogated by treatment with the FLT3 PTK inhibitor PKC412 (midostaurin). Conclusion: CBL exon8/9 mutants occur in genetically defined AML/MDS subtypes and transform hematopoietic cells by constitutively activatingthe FLT3 pathway. This phenotype resembles the one of mutated RTKs and suggests that CBL mutant AML patients might benefit from treatment with FLT3 PTK inhibitors. CBL, a known negative regulator of activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), is localized on human chromosome 11q23, a region frequently associated with chromosomal aberrations. Translocations t(4;11) and t(11;14), and mixed-lineage leukemia fusion genes involving CBL have been described in patients with leukemia and lymphoma (1â€“3). CBL oncogenes were initially identified in the murine system. CBL-70Z, carrying an internal deletion of 17 amino acids, was isolated from the 70Z/ 3 mouse pre-B-cell lymphoma cell line (4). CBL-70Z deregulates the cellular tyrosine kinase machinery, as NIH3T3 serumstarved cells expressing CBL-70Z showed significantly increased endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase activity after EGF stimulation (5). p95CBL, expressed in the murine reticulum sarcoma cell line J-774, lacks internal 111 amino acids, comprising whole exons 8 and 9 (6). CBL70Z and p95CBL mutations both target the linker and RING finger domain, which points to a mutation-sensitive region within the CBL protein. Recently the first human CBL mutation has been reported in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; ref. 7).

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer in the RING finger domain (8, 9) and was shown to inhibit FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitylation (7). Additional screenings of AML patients revealed more cases with CBL mutations, including internal deletions of exon 8 and point mutations targeting G375 (10, 11). Activating FLT3 mutations represent one of the most common genetic alterations in AML and are associated with a poor prognosis (12). Overexpression of wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT) has been shown to synergize with other oncogenic fusions to induce aggressive AML in mice (13). Because of these reasons, FLT3 is a prominent target for therapeutic intervention. Currently two compounds targeting FLT3 kinase activity, PKC412 (midostaurin) and CEP701(lestaurtinib), have reached clinical phase III (14). As patients that do not carry activating FLT3 mutations benefit from treatment with FLT3 inhibitors (15), we hypothesized that other mechanisms, such as CBL mutations, might contribute to the oncogenic potential of FLT3. Here, we report a frequency of 1.1% of CBL exon8/9 mutations in AML/ myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Three of the four newly diagnosed AML/MDS patients expressed CBL lacking exon 8 or exon 8/9 and one patient carried a R420G missense mutation. Aberrant CBL transcripts were lost in remission samples. CBL is part of the human FLT3 downstream signaling pathway and promoted down-regulation of FLT3 activity. Finally, CBL deletion mutants CBLDExon8 and CBL exon8/9 transformed Ba/F3 cells in the presence, but not in the absence of FLT3-WT. Materials and Methods Analysis of cell lines and patient samples. The study design adhered to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the ethics committees of participating institutions.

PCR screening of cDNA was done with forward primer 5Â¶-CATCCTGGCTACATGGCTTT-3Â¶, localized in exon 5, and reverse primer 5Â¶-GCAGAAGCACTTGAGGGAAC-3Â¶, localized in exon 10, yielding a 752-bp PCR product corresponding to nucleotides 793 to 1544 of the published human CBL sequence (genebank accession number NM_005188). Sequencing was done using the forward primer. For screening of normal human hematopoietic tissues the Human MTC panel II (Clontech) was used. For analysis of gDNA a 8050-bp fragment was amplified using forward primer 5Â¶-GACTAATGTGGCCTACAAATCCTAA-3Â¶, localized in intron 6, and reverse primer 5Â¶-GTTGGTTAATTCTCTTCCTGTCCA-3Â¶, localized in exon 11. Sequencing was done using the forward and reverse primer as well as the following primers: 5Â¶-CTGTTAACATTTATAATTGCAGT-3Â¶, 5Â¶-GACAGATATTGTGTTAAGCAC-3Â¶, 5Â¶-GAGTGAGTTGTGATTGTACC-3Â¶. 5Â¶-TAGCTGGATGGTAGGTAAGT-3Â¶, 5Â¶-ATAGTAGTATGTGATACCGTG-3Â¶, 5Â¶-TTCCTCATCCTTGATTTGATG-3Â¶, 5Â¶-GCTTGTTAGGGAGTTGTGG-3Â¶, 5Â¶-CAAAGAGTTAAAGATGAGAGC-3Â¶, 5Â¶-GATCTCACTATGTTGACAAGGC-3Â¶. PCR fragment analysis was done as described previously (17) with forward primer 5Â¶-TGGCTTATGTGAACCAACTCC-3Â¶ in exon 7 and reverse primer 5Â¶-CTTGAGGGAACACATACTCG-3Â¶ in exon 10 yielding peaks at 483 (CBL-WT), 353 (CBLDexon8) and 148 (CBLDexon8/9) nucleotides.

Translational Relevance In this article we provide detailed insight into the role of oncogenic CBL exon8/9 mutations in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but we could not find CBL mutations in our acute lymphoblastic leukemia cohort. Analysis of a large cohort of AML/MDS patients of different cytogenetic subgroups revealed an overall low frequency of CBL exon 8+9 deletions of 1.1%. However, we identified preferential association of CBL exon8/9 mutations with core bindingfactor leukemias and 11q aberrations. We describe that all known human CBL deletion mutants lead to transformation of wild-type FLT3 ^ expressing hematopoietic cells. This phenotype resembles that seen with activated receptor tyrosine kinases. Therefore, it is of particular note that analysis of CBL should be introduced in routine leukemia diagnostics, as patients who harbor CBL mutations might benefit from treatment with FLT3 protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

For intracellular localization studies, U2OS human osteosarcoma cells were grown on coverslips and cotransfected with V5-FLT3 and HAtagged CBL expression plasmids as described above. After 48 h the cells were stimulated with 100 ng/mL FLT3 ligand while control cells where left untreated, and 30 min after stimulation the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with PBS 0.1% Triton X for 10 min, and blocked with PBS 10% FCS for 1 h. Coverslips were incubated overnight with polyclonal rabbit HA antibodies (Santa Cruz) and monoclonal mouse V5 antibodies (Invitrogen). Following extensive washing with PBS, Alexa 555 and Alexa 488 conjugated secondary antibodies were added for 1h. After further washing steps, the cells were stained with 4â€™,6-diamidino-2- phenylindole and mounted using Cytomat medium (DAKO).

Results A subset of AML/MDS patients carries mutations in the protooncogene CBL. Recent reports have indicated a putative contribution of CBL mutations to the pathogenesis of human leukemias (7, 10). To obtain a comprehensive insight into the role of CBL in human acute leukemias, we firstly did a PCR screening of the cDNA of 61AML and 21acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines (Table 1; Supplementary Table S1) for deletions in the linker and RING finger domains. We identified a monoallelic CBL deletion transcript in the AML cell line MOLM-13 and the sister cell line MOLM-14. Sequencing of the aberrant transcripts revealed loss of the complete coding sequence of exon 8. All other analyzed cell lines expressed exclusively wild-type CBL (CBL-WT). Secondly, we used the above PCR screening assay to analyze a well-characterized cohort of AML/MDS and ALL patient samples for the presence of aberrant CBL transcripts (Table 1A). Among 279 AML samples of different cytogenetic subtypes and 21T-cell ALL samples we detected three AML/MDS patients expressing CBLWT as well as an aberrant CBL transcript (Table 1B). Patient 1 with a t(8;21) (AML1/ETO positive) and patient 2 with an 11q deletion both expressed a CBL transcript lacking exon 8, and patient 3 with an inv(16) (CBFB/MYH11 positive) expressed CBL lacking exon 8 and 9 (Table 1B; Fig. 1A). By PCR fragment analysis we determined the relative expression of mutant versus CBL-WT. For patient 1we detected 40% mutant versus 60% wild-type transcript. For patient 2 a 20% mutant versus 80% wild-type transcript was observed, supposedly due to the low blast count (20%) in the patient sample. Patient 3 showed equal ratios of mutant versus wild-type transcripts (data not shown). To verify that the shorter CBL transcripts were expressed in the malignant cell population, we analyzed remission samples in the case of patients 1and 3. Conventional PCR screening of remission samples from patient 1showed a weak expression of the transcript lacking exon 8 (Fig. 1B). PCR fragment analysis revealed that still 15% to 20% of the mutant CBL was present in the remission sample (data not shown). In case of patient 3 the PCR screening as well as the fragment analysis showed loss of the mutant CBL transcript lacking exon 8 and 9 in remission. To exclude the possibility of normally occurring splice variants, we analyzed the cDNA of normal human hematopoietic tissues, in detail normal bone marrow, peripheral leukocytes, spleen, and thymus. All of the analyzed tissues expressed exclusively CBL-WT transcripts (data not shown). In addition to the PCR screening, a subset of 116 PCR products from AML/MDS patients of all subtypes were analyzed by nucleotide sequencing comprising the region of exon 7, 8 and 9. One AML/MDS patient with an 11q aberration showed a substitution of arginine to glycine at position 420, which is located in the RING finger domain (Table 1B, Fig. 1A). In summary, we identified 2 of 61AML cell lines [3.3% (0.4%, 11.3%)] and 3 of 279 (1.1%) AML/MDS patients expressing aberrant CBL transcripts deleted in the linker and RING finger domains of CBL. Aberrant CBL transcripts could not be detected in any of the analyzed ALL cell lines and ALL patient samples. A murine CBL deletion transcript has been described in the 70Z/3 B-cell lymphoma cell line (CBL-70Z lacking the first 17 amino acids of exon 8; ref. 4). In the 70Z/3 line the causative event is a splice site mutation, changing the splice acceptor site AG to CG, generating an alternative splice site, which excludes the first 17 amino acids of exon 8 (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the genomic DNA of MOLM-13 cells detected a deletion of 14 nucleotides at the exon 8/intron 8 boundary eliminating a Table 1. A.

Two patients belong to CBF leukemias [t(8;21); inv(16)] and two patients harbor 11q aberrations. *A detailed listing of all cell lines is given in Supplementary Table 1.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer splicing element leading to expression of the CBLDexon8 mutant (data not shown), as had been described previously (10). By amplifying a 8,050-bp fragment of genomic DNA spanning intron 6 to exon 11 and subsequent nucleotide sequencing, we detected mutations in all three patients expressing aberrant CBL transcripts (data not shown). One allele of patient 1(CBLDexon8) harbored a deletion of 43 nucleotides at the exon 8-intron 8 boundary, including the last 36 nucleotides of exon 8 and the first 7 nucleotides of intron 8, thereby losing the whole splice donor site of intron 8. Analysis of the genomic DNA of patient 2 (CBLDexon8) revealed a point mutation of the splice donor site of intron 8, changing the conserved â€˜â€˜GTâ€™â€™ to â€˜â€˜GCâ€™â€™ in about 10% of the amplified DNA. The sample from patient 2 contained only 20% blasts, suggesting that this mutation occurred in one of the CBL alleles of the malignant clone. Patient 3 (CBLDexon8+9) carries a monoallelic large genomic deletion of 1,680 nucleotides, starting in intron 7 and ending in intron 9 leading to the loss of exon 8 and 9. In conclusion, all CBL transcripts, which lack whole exons, can be explained by genomic events that target splice donor or acceptor sites by mutations or deletions. CBL interacts with the FLT3 receptor and contributes to FLT3 downstream signaling. As CBL is known to be involved in the signal transduction of class III RTKs, platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA), FMS (colony forming growth factor 1 receptor), and KIT (stem cell factor receptor) (19â€“ 21), we hypothesized that CBL mutants might play a role in human FLT3 downstream signaling. Lysates of FLT3-WT expressing Ba/ F3 cells with or without FLT3 ligand stimulation were analyzed for the phosphorylation status of endogenous CBL. We could show that activation of human FLT3 after binding of FLT3 ligand leads to high levels of phosphorylated CBL in FLT3-WTâ€“ expressing cells, whereas the kinase-dead mutant receptor (FLT3-R644K) cells do not show phosphorylated CBL (Fig. 2A). To localize the interaction site within the FLT3-WT receptor we substituted two essential in vivo autophosphorylation sites of FLT3, tyrosines Y589 and Y599 (22), with phenylalanine. FLT3Y589F and FLT3Y599F receptorâ€“expressing cells show a remarkable decrease of CBL phosphorylation after FLT3 ligand stimulation compared with FLT3-WT â€“ expressing cells (Fig. 2A). We conclude that Y589 and Y599 participate in the interaction of the FLT3 receptor with CBL. To detect interaction of FLT3 and CBL, we did coimmunoprecipitation experiments with lysates from FLT3 ligand â€“ stimulated cells expressing V5-tagged FLT3-WT alone or together with CBLWT or CBL-70Z. Figure 2B shows that CBL-WT and CBL-70Z, interact with the FLT3 receptor. The FLT3 receptor is generally detected as two distinct bands, the mature glycosylated form at 155 kDa and the immature cytoplasmic form at 130 kDa (23). The interaction between CBL-WT and CBL-70Z with FLT3 occurred predominantly with the mature form of FLT3 (higher band). To study the interaction between the FLT3 receptor and CBL at the cellular level, we did in vivo colocalization experiments using immunofluorescence of FLT3 and CBL-WT. In U2OS human osteosarcoma cells transiently transfected FLT3 localizes to the cell membrane and the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C). In the cytoplasm FLT3 accumulates in the perinuclear endoplasmatic reticulum, consistent with recent reports (24). CBL shows a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. Stimulation of the cells with FLT3 ligand results in internalization of FLT3, which is indicated by loss of FLT3 staining in the cell membrane and formation of endosomal vesicles. Upon addition of FLT3 ligand, CBL clearly colocalizes with internalized FLT3 in the endosomal vesicles. CBL regulates the function of EGFR via ubiquitin-dependent degradation of EGFR (25, 26). Therefore, we sought to investigate if CBL negatively regulates human FLT3. Two hundred and ninety-three cells were transiently transfected with FLT3-WT alone or FLT3-WT and CBL-WT and stimulated with FLT3 ligand for different time periods. Lysates were analyzed for FLT3 phosphorylation and total levels of FLT3 protein. Figure 2D shows constant phosphorylation and levels of FLT3 protein in FLT3-WTâ€“ transfected cells up to 120 minutes, Fig. 1. Identified CBL mutants in AML patients. Aberrant CBL transcripts are lost in remission.

Shown below are the CBL deletion mutants, CBLDexon8 and CBLDexon8+9, found in AML patients, CBL-70Z, a known oncogenic form of CBL, comprisinga deletion of the first 17 amino acids within exon 8, and the location of R420, found to be mutated in one AML patient in our study.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer whereas the phospho-tyrosine signal is comparably less in double-transfected cells after 60 minutes and barely detectable after 120 minutes. The total protein levels of FLT3 are significantly reduced after 90 minutes of FLT3 ligand stimulation in the double-transfected cells compared with FLT3-WT â€“ transfected cells, implicating an enhanced degradation of FLT3 by CBL. CBL mutants confer a transforming potential to Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-WT. In light of the direct interaction between FLT3 and CBL and the modulation of FLT3 signaling by CBL, we hypothesized that CBL mutants could activate the oncogenic potential of FLT3-WT in AML blasts. The following CBL mutants found in AML/MDS patients and leukemic cell lines, CBLDexon8, CBLDexon8+9 and CBLR420 and CBLG375 point mutants, as well as CBL-WT and CBL-70Z as a positive control, were generated and subcloned into MSCVGFP. FLT3-WT was subcloned into MSCV-YFP vector. All CBL constructs were stably expressed alone or together with FLT3- WT in Ba/F3 cells. Positive selection was done by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting. The expression of transduced human CBL in FLT3-WT/CBL coexpressing cells was higher than the expression of endogenous CBL, as analyzed by real time quantitative-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and verified by Western Blot analysis for the CBLDexon8+9 mutant (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Expression of any single CBL construct alone or coexpression of CBL-WT and FLT3-WT did not confer growth factor independent proliferation to Ba/F3 cells (data not shown). However, coexpression of CBL-70Z, CBLDexon8 or CBLDexon8+9 with FLT3-WT led to significant IL-3 independent proliferation (Fig. 3A). Compared with the CBL deletion mutants, expression of CBL R420G, R420Q, G375S, and G375P point mutants did not confer any proliferative capacity, but enhanced cell survival, as 50% of cells survived for 3 days after IL-3 withdrawal compared with 10% survival of the control cells (data not shown). The presence of FLT3 ligand induced a strong dosedependent proliferation of FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z, FLT3-WT/ CBLDexon8, and FLT3-WT/CBLDexon8+9 cotransduced cells Fig. 2. CBL is phosphorylated after activation of human FLT3-WT, directly interacts with FLT3 through tyrosines Y589 and Y599, and negatively regulates FLT3WT. A, unstimulated (-) or FLT3 ligand (FL) ^ stimulated (+; 5 min; 100 ng/mL) Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-WT, FLT3Y589F, FLT3Y599F, or FLT3K644R were lysed, and endogenous CBL protein was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal CBL antibody and analyzed for the tyrosine phosphorylation status by immunoblottingwith phospho-Tyrosine antibody. B, 293 cells were transfected with MIY (control),V5-tagged FLT3-WT CBL-WTorV5-tagged FLT3-WT CBL-70Z and stimulated with 100 ng/mL FLT3 ligand for 5 min. Coimmunoprecipitation of CBL and FLT3 was done with polyclonal CBL antibody. After separation on SDS-PAGE and blottingon nitrocellulose membrane, V5-tagged FLT3-WTwas detected with monoclonal V5 antibody. Control samples contained either no or unspecific IgG antibody.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer with a proliferation rate about 4 to 6 times higher than the control cells (Fig. 3B). The FLT3-WT/CBLG375 cotransduced cells showed no increase in proliferation rate compared with FLT3-WT cells. The FLT3-WT/CBLR420Q mutant cells showed a 2-fold enhanced proliferation rate compared with FLT3-WT cells (data not shown). Incubation of the FLT3-WT/CBL mutant coexpressing cells with the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 in increasing nontoxic concentrations up to 50 nmol/L or the FLT3 inhibitor SU5614 up to 5 Amol/L in the presence of 50 ng/mL FLT3 ligand led to a dose-dependent abrogation of the proliferation (Fig. 3C). Coexpression of a kinase-dead FLT3 receptor, FLT3K644R, with CBL-70Z provided further evidence that the FLT3 kinase activity is required for the transformed phenotype, as it did not lead to IL-3 â€“independent proliferation (data not shown). Collectively, the overexpression of CBL-70Z, CBLDexon8 or CBLDexon8+9 in FLT3-WT â€“expressing Ba/F3 cells led to factor independent growth and FLT3 ligandâ€“ dependent hyperproliferation. Coexpression of CBL deletion mutants with FLT3-WT autoactivates the FLT3 receptor. The known classes of FLT3 mutations have been shown to autoactivate the kinase activity of FLT3 (16, 27â€“ 30). We prepared lysates of FLT3 ligand â€“ stimulated and nonstimulated Ba/F3 cells coexpressing FLT3- WT and a CBL deletion mutant, immunoprecipitated the FLT3 receptor, and analyzed it for tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast to FLT3-WT- or FLT3-WT/CBL-WT â€“expressing cells, all three CBL mutantâ€“expressing cells displayed autophosphorylated FLT3 in the absence of FLT3 ligand (Fig. 4A). Stimulation with FLT3 ligand induced high phosphorylation levels of FLT3 Fig. 3. CBL deletion mutants induce a transformingpotential in FLT3-WT ^ expressingBa/F3 cells and respond to FLT3 PTK inhibitor treatment A, cells stably transduced with FLT3-WTalone or FLT3-WTand CBL-WT, CBL-70Z, CBLDexon8 or CBLDexon8+9 were cultured in the absence of IL3 for 72 h and viable cells counted after trypan blue exclusion. B, cells were analyzed accordingto A, but different concentrations of FL up to 100 ng/mL were added to the culture medium. C, cells were analyzed accordingto A, but 50 ng/mL FLT3 ligand and different concentrations of the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 up to 50 nmol/L or SU5614 up to 5 Amol/L were added to the culture medium. Three independent experiments were done. CBL exon8/9 Mutants in AML/MDS Subtypes www.aacrjournals.org 2243 Clin Cancer Res 2009;15(7) April 1, 2009 Research. Downloaded from clincancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 27, 2017. Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer in all analyzed cells. The amount of phosphorylated FLT3 in FLT3-WT/CBL mutantâ€“expressing cells was considerably higher than in control cells, as was the amount of total FLT3 protein. This confirms the hypothesis that coexpression of a CBL deletion mutant, but not CBL-WT, leads to a remarkable stabilization of the FLT3 protein within the cells by inhibiting the down-regulation and degradation of the FLT3 protein. Analysis of the phosphorylation status of transduced CBL in FLT3-WT/CBL mutant â€“expressing cells revealed that all CBL mutants became phosphorylated after stimulation of the cells with FLT3 ligand (Fig. 4B). Of note, we detected a weak constitutive phosphorylation of CBL mutants, but not CBL-WT, in the absence of FL. Autoactivation of FLT3 results in ligand-independent signaling of the receptor (31, 32). We therefore analyzed the activation of three important downstream signaling effectors of FLT3: signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinases B (AKT), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Activated STAT5 and AKT were detected in unstimulated FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z-, Fig. 4. Coexpression of CBL deletion mutants autoactivates FLT3, CBL mutants, and the downstream signaling pathways STAT5 and AKTA, Mock, FLT3-WT, FLT3-WT/CBL-WT, FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z, FLT3-WT/CBLDexon8, and FLT3-WT/ CBLDexon8+9 cells were starved for 24 h in the presence of 0.3% FCS and unstimulated or stimulated with 100 ng/mL FLT3 ligand for 5 min. FLT3 was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal FLT3 antibody and analyzed by immunoblottingwith phospho-tyrosine antibody, stripped, and reprobed with FLT3 antibody. B, CBL-WTand CBL mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated with hemagglutinin- orV5-antibody and analyzed as described in A. C, cells were treated accordingtoA and crude cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed for phosphorylation of STAT5 and AKTusing phospho-specific antibodies. D, WST proliferation assays were done in presence of FLT3 ligand and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer FLT3-WT/CBLDexon8-, and FLT3-WT/CBLDexon8+9 â€“ coexpressing cells but not FLT3-WT- or FLT3-WT/CBL-WT â€“ coexpressing cells (Fig. 4C). However, no differences were observed in MAPK activation, as all unstimulated cells lack phosphorylated MAPK (data not shown). To evaluate the contribution of the PI3K pathway to the FLT3 ligand â€“ dependent proliferation of FLT3-WT/CBL mutant â€“ expressing cells, we analyzed the proliferative capacity of FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z â€“ coexpressing cells and FLT3-WT/CBL-WT control cells in the presence of the small molecule inhibitors LY294002 and rapamycin. LY294002 is a well known PI3K inhibitor (33) and rapamycin specifically inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, a downstream target of PI3K (34, 35). Both compounds were able to significantly, but not totally, inhibit the proliferation of FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z cells (Fig. 4D). The IC50 value for FLT3- WT/CBL-70Z â€“expressing cells were 3.8 Amol/L for LY294002 and 0.5 nmol/L for rapamycin, pointing to a strong contribution of the PI3K/AKT pathway to the transforming phenotype of FLT3/CBL mutant â€“ coexpressing cells. Incubation of the cells with the maximum used concentration of inhibitor in presence of IL-3 was not cytotoxic (data not shown). Expression of CBL-70Z in FLT3-WT cells does not alter the internalization of the FLT3 receptor. Analysis of EGFR activity has shown that CBL promotes the invagination of the plasma membrane during receptor endocytosis (25, 26, 36). CBL-70Z has been proposed to act in a dominant negative manner preventing binding of CBL-WT to activated RTKs (37). We intended to analyze whether the expression of CBL-WT or CBL-70Z might alter the rate or timing of FLT3 internalization after activation with FLT3 ligand. We did staining of FLT3 or FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z â€“expressing cells with CD135 antibody to detect the levels of FLT3 on the surface dependent on the time of FLT3 ligand stimulation up to 60 minutes. In FLT3-WT cells the FLT3 receptor is rapidly internalized after 10 to 20 minutes of FLT3 ligand stimulation (Fig. 5). In contrast to FLT3-WT the kinase-dead FLT3K644R, which served as a control, was not internalized even after 60 minutes of FLT3 ligand stimulation. Coexpression of CBL-WT (data not shown) or the mutant CBL- 70Z had no effect on the receptor turnover as after 20 minutes of FLT3 ligand stimulation FLT3 was undetectable on the cell surface in all analyzed cells. Discussion Growth factors and their associated membrane bound receptors play an important role in the initiation and propagation of many types of cancer (38). As the aberrant activation of RTKs by overexpression and activating mutations is a well-investigated topic in oncology research, it is becoming increasingly clear that impaired receptor down-regulation might contribute to the malignant phenotype as well (39). Receptor down-regulation involves ligand-induced endocytosis and subsequent degradation of the proteins in the lysosomes, leading to termination of RTK signaling and, in case of disturbance, to aberrantly extended signaling. Recent findings have addressed the aberrant down-regulation of FLT3 by CBL in AML (7, 10, 11). In this study we provide a comprehensive insight by analyzing 300 AML/MDS and ALL cases. Four of 279 AML/MDS patients, but no ALL patients, were found positive for expression of aberrant CBL transcripts in the linker and RING finger domains, previously characterized as the critical location for transforming mutations. The equivalently analyzed large number of AML and ALL cell lines revealed two positive AML cell lines, MOLM-13 and the sister cell line MOLM-14, which matches the results obtained in patient material and points to a low frequency of CBL mutations in AML. However, an independent study found 1of 12 AML patients with a point mutation in CBL-b (10), a CBL family member, highlighting the importance of further studies to determine the contribution of CBL members to the pathogenesis of AML (10). Of more importance was whether other aberrations in other negative regulatory molecules, e.g. SHP phosphatases, lead to deregulated RTK activity. Three of the described aberrant CBL transcripts lack whole exons, which were significantly decreased in expression or not detectable in the patientâ€™s remission controls. Screening of Fig. 5. The internalization of FLT3-WT is not disturbed by coexpression of CBL70Z. Ba/F3 cells expressingFLT3-WT, FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z, or FLT3-KD were stimulated with FLT3 ligand for different time periods from 0 min up to 60 min. After stimulation cells were immediately incubated on ice and cell membranes fixed by addition of 0.3% sodium azide. Cells were stained with FLT3-specific surface antibody and analyzed in fluorescence-activated cell sorter for surface expression levels of FLT3.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer normal hematopoietic tissues did not show aberrant CBL transcripts, further pointing to an oncogenic event in the malignant clone. Indeed, all three patients carried genomic lesions affecting splice donor or acceptor sites by mutation or deletion, so that we can clearly exclude aberrant splicing events within the malignant clone. Of note, we detected a preferential association of CBL mutations with specific subtypes of AML/MDS. Among 43 cases of core binding factor leukemias [t(8;21) and inv(16)] two patients expressing aberrant CBL transcripts were identified [4.7% (0.6%, 15.8%)]. As core binding factor leukemias show a high expression of the RTK KIT (40), further studies need to address the question of whether CBL mutations might lead to autoactivation of KIT in these patients. Two of 13 patients with 11q deletions were found positive [15.4% (1.9%, 45.4%)]. This AML/MDS subgroup shows the highest FLT3 expression among all AML subgroups (41), so that CBL mutations might be the event causing the high FLT3 expression and an aberrant FLT3 activation in these patients. CBL was shown to be responsible for ubiquitination of several receptors including EGFR, PDGFRA, and FMS (25, 42, 43). Until now only indirect evidence existed for a role of CBL in human FLT3 downstream signaling. Lavagna-Sevenier et al. reported prominent CBL phosphorylation in human hematopoietic cell lines expressing endogenous FLT3 (44). Recently Sargin et al. reported the physical interaction of CBL with a murine chimeric FLT3 receptor, where the juxtamembrane domain has been replaced by human sequences (7). Their study presents further indirect evidence that CBL is the responsible E3 ligase ubiquitinating the chimeric murine FLT3 receptor after binding of FLT3 ligand. However, this remains to be tested for human FLT3. Here, we provide clear evidence that murine endogenous CBL is rapidly phosphorylated after activation of the human FLT3-WT receptor. As murine and human CBL share 92% homology, we conclude that this signaling event is conserved from mice to humans. Recently Heiss et al. identified two important in vivo autophosphorylation sites of human FLT3 after FLT3 ligand stimulation, tyrosines 589 and 599, which associate with important signaling molecules, like Src family members and SHP2 (22). Mutation of Y589 and Y599 to phenylalanine revealed a significantly decreased phosphorylation of CBL in response to FLT3 ligand stimulation of the mutant FLT3 receptors, implicating that these tyrosines serve as docking sites. A similar effect has been seen for the corresponding juxtamembrane tyrosines Y568 and Y570 in KIT and Y572 and Y574 in PDGFRa (21 , 45). However, as still small amounts of phosphorylated CBL were detectable, we propose that FLT3 contains more interaction sites for CBL, which might be direct or indirect via adaptor proteins, e.g. GRB2. Additional COOHterminal association sites of CBL have been described for FMS (Y973) and for KIT (Y936; refs. 19, 46). In coimmunoprecipitation experiments we have shown interaction of overexpressed human FLT3-WT with human CBL-WT after FLT3 ligand stimulation. The interaction of CBL-70Z with FLT3-WT was even more pronounced, indicating that the interaction of mutant CBL and FLT3 might be more stable and might be very efficient in blocking CBL-WT from binding sites on activated FLT3 receptors. In vivo colocalization experiments confirmed colocalization of FLT3 and CBL in endosomal vesicles after FLT3 ligand stimulation of cells. It has been suggested that CBL ubiquitylates FLT3 (7). Here, we show that the presence of overexpressed CBLWT enhances down-regulation of FLT3 after binding of FLT3 ligand, providing direct evidence for a functional role of CBL in down-regulation of FLT3 activity. To analyze the transforming potential of CBL mutants we have chosen the IL-3 â€“dependent cell line BaF3, as it is a valuable model for the investigation of activated RTKs. We analyzed all human CBL mutations thus far detected and CBL- 70Z as a control. Only cells coexpressing FLT3-WT and a CBL deletion mutant were able to proliferate in the absence of IL-3. CBL point mutants coexpressed with FLT3WT showed enhanced survival, but no proliferative capacity in BaF3 cells. This finding is in contrast to the recent study of Sargin et al., in which the R420Q point mutation induced IL-3 â€“independent growth in myeloid 32D cells (7). This discrepancy may arise from the different cell systems used and highlights the need to analyze the phenotype of CBL mutations in primary cells. The addition of exogenous FLT3 ligand induced a rapid proliferative response to FLT3-WT CBL deletion mutant â€“ coexpressing cells. As AML blasts coexpress FLT3 ligand leading to an autocrine stimulation, this phenotype mimics the in vivo situation (47, 48). In the case of CBL point mutants only R420Q, but not G375 mutants, show significant growth in vitro in presence of FLT3 ligand. Coexpression of a CBL mutant autophosphorylates FLT3 and downstream molecules STAT5 and AKT. Additionally, CBL mutants themselves are constitutively phosphorylated, which points to a so far undescribed mechanism independent from the proposed dominant negative mechanism, in which CBL mutants block CBL-WT from binding sites at activated RTKs (47). Consistent with a dominant negative behavior of CBL mutants is the fact that we detected higher levels of FLT3 protein in FLT3/CBL mutant cells compared with control cells, as the increased stability of the FLT3 protein should be the result of a decreased degradation of FLT3. Analyzing the internalization rate of FLT3 in FLT3-WT and FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z cells revealed no difference in rate and speed of internalization; thus, early steps of endocytosis of FLT3 seem not to be affected by the presence of a CBL deletion mutant. This is in concert with a study from Jiang et al., in which late stages of endocytosis, but not recruitment of EGFR into coated pits, were affected by CBL-70Z (48). However, Sargin et al. found a slightly reduced internalization of FLT3 in the presence of CBL-70Z and CBLR420Q, so that this information is in conflict and needs to be clarified. Taken together, aberrant CBL transcripts occur in AML and are associated with core binding factor leukemias and 11q aberrations. The CBL deletion mutants show a transforming phenotype in BaF3 cells in the presence of FLT3, that resembles the phenotype seen in FLT3-activating mutations (FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, FLT3-JM-PM). This new mechanism of activation through mutated negative-regulatory molecules of RTKs opens a door for treating patients with PTK inhibitors, who do not carry mutations in the RTK itself.  Acquired somatic uniparental disomy (UPD) is commonly observed in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), or secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (sAML) and may point toward genes harboring mutations. Recurrent UPD11q led to identification of homozygous mutations in c-Cbl, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in attenuation of proliferative signals transduced by activated receptor tyrosine kinases. We examined the role and frequency of Cbl gene family mutations in MPN and related conditions.  Methods  We applied high-density SNP-A karyotyping to identify loss of heterozygosity of 11q in 442 patients with MDS, MDS/MPN, MPN, sAML evolved from these conditions, and primary AML. We sequenced c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c in patients with or without corresponding UPD or deletions and correlated mutational status with clinical features and outcomes.  Results  We identified c-Cbl mutations in 5% and 9% of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and sAML, and also in CML blast crisis and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Most mutations were homozygous and affected c-Cbl; mutations in Cbl-b were also found in patients with similar clinical features. Patients with Cbl family mutations showed poor prognosis, with a median survival of 5 months. Pathomorphologic features included monocytosis, monocytoid blasts, aberrant expression of phosphoSTAT5, and c-kit overexpression. Serial studies showed acquisition of c-Cbl mutations during malignant evolution.  Conclusion  Mutations in the Cbl family RING finger domain or linker sequence constitute important pathogenic lesions associated with not only preleukemic CMML, JMML, and other MPN, but also progression to AML, suggesting that impairment of degradation of activated tyrosine kinases constitutes an important cancer mechanism.  Go to: INTRODUCTION Mutations and genomic aberrations constitute key pathogenic lesions in myeloid malignancies. In primary acute myelogenous leukemia (pAML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), reciprocal translocations have enhanced our understanding of molecular pathogenesis, improved diagnosis and provided rational therapeutic targets. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), and AML evolved from MDS or MDS/MPN (secondary AML [sAML]), unbalanced chromosomal lesions predominate and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is of particular importance. LOH can arise either via hemizygous deletion, where a DNA segment is lost from one homolog while the other remains at one copy per cell, or by uniparental disomy (UPD), wherein the retained homolog is duplicated to preserve two total copies per cell at the locus. Thus, analysis of recurrent regions of LOH may point toward the presence of important mutations. Mutations seen in MDS and AML affect specific classes of genes and indicate general pathways of leukemia evolution.1 For example, mutations have been found in a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases, including c-Kit, c-Mpl, and Flt-3.2â€“4 Mutations also affect signal transduction genes such as Jak2 and NPM-1. tP53 constitutes an example of a proapoptotic tumor suppressor gene mutated in aggressive leukemias.5â€“7  Until recently, metaphase cytogenetics was applied for detection of chromosomal defects including deletions resulting in LOH. Using this technique, a number of invariant chromosomal abnormalities have been described and minimal affected regions delineated, pointing towards potentially pathogenic genes. Single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) â€“based cytogenetic analysis allows for better resolution of chromosomal defects, with identification of previously cryptic unbalanced lesions.8 In particular, SNP-A is able to identify UPD. We and others have recently shown that somatic UPD affecting various chromosomes can be found frequently in MDS, MDS/MPN, and sAML and have identified a number of recurrent areas.9â€“11 Initially, UPD9p was shown to lead to homozygosity of the Jak2 V617F mutation in MPN.12â€“14 Using SNP-A, we have demonstrated that other areas of UPD can also be associated with homozygous mutations, including UPD13p (Flt-3 ITD) and UPD1p (c-Mpl).15,16 Based on this paradigm, we recently identified a novel recurrent area of UPD at 11q, frequently present in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and AML evolved from atypical MDS/MPN, and through delineation of a commonly deleted region have identified mutations in c-Cbl.15 c-Cbl is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in degradation of activated receptor tyrosine kinases and other tyrosine kinases, including Src kinases. Consequently, mutations affecting the RING finger domain (RFD) may have a wide range of effects on proliferation regulation, crucial to both MPN and AML. In animal studies, c-Cbl knockout led to hyper-responsiveness to ligand stimulation and expansion of them in cell pools, overall resulting in a mild proliferative phenotype.17 However, RFD mutation knock-in in a c-Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ mouse model resulted in a myeloproliferative phenotype and leukemic evolution (W.Y. Langdon, personal communication, December 2008). In a transgenic MDS NUP98/HOX13 mouse model, progression to sAML with acquisition of RAS and c-Cbl mutations occurs frequently.18  We hypothesized that mutations inactivating oncogene degradation pathways may constitute a new class of molecular lesions in myeloid malignancies modifying current paradigms of leukemogenesis. We therefore investigated the presence of mutations in the Cbl family of E3 ubiqutin ligases in selected subtypes of malignant myeloid disorders and determined the phenotypic and functional features as well as clinical outcomes. Based on the study of these features we set out to discern the pathophysiologic principles of molecular dysfunction created by E3 ubiquitin ligase lesions.  Go to: METHODS Patients  Bone marrow aspirates were collected from 442 patients with MDS (n = 115), MDS/MPN (n = 98), MPN (n = 22), sAML (n = 110) evolved from these conditions, and pAML (n = 97) seen at Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins Hospital between 2003 and 2008 (Appendix Table A1, online only). Informed consent for sample collection was obtained according to protocols approved by institutional review boards. Diagnosis was confirmed at each primary institution and assigned according to WHO classification criteria.19  Single Nuclotide Polymorphism Array Analysis  High-density Affymetrix SNP-A (250K and 6.0 arrays; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) were applied as a karyotyping platform to identify LOH on chromosome 11q. Lesions identified by SNP-A were compared to the Database of Genomic Variants20 (http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/) and an internal control series (n = 1,003) to exclude known copy number variations. To confirm all regions of LOH detected by 250K SNP-A, we repeated samples when possible on 6.0 arrays and analyzed using Genotyping Console version 2.0 (Affymetrix). Signal intensity was analyzed and SNP calls determined using Gene Chip Genotyping Analysis Software version 4.0 (GTYPE, Affymetrix). Copy number and areas of UPD were investigated using a Hidden Markov Model and CN Analyzer for Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 250K arrays (CNAG version 3.0) as previously described.21  E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Mutational Screening  To screen patients for mutations in c-Cbl, Cbl-b, Cbl-c, and Hakai, direct genomic sequencing of all exons was performed (details of primers and conditions are available on request). For sequencing, 250 ng of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product, 3 Î¼mol/L original forward or reverse primer, 2 Î¼L Big Dye version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and 14.5 Î¼L deionized H2O were amplified under the following conditions: 95Â°C (2 minutes) followed by 25 cycles of 95Â°C (10 seconds), 50Â°C (5 seconds), and 60Â°C (4 minutes). Sequencing was performed as previously described.15 If a mutation was intronic, RNA was extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction performed for confirmation of splice variants.  Immunohistochemical Detection of pSTAT5  Staining was performed on a Benchmark XT platform (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ), according to the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions, using mouse monoclonal antiphospho-STAT5a/b (Y694/99; Advantex BioReagents LLP, Conroe, TX) at 1:500 dilution. All stains were scored without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis or mutational status. Phospho-STAT5-positive staining (nMEG pSTAT5) was defined as previously reported.22,23 Images were obtained via digital microscopy using an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus America, Melville, NY) equipped with either a UPlanFl 40Ã—/0.75 numeric aperture (NA) or a UPlanFl 100 Ã—/1.30 NA objective. Images were captured using a Dage-MTI Model DC330E charge-coupled device camera (Dage-MTI, Michigan City, IN) attached to the microscope with a U-TV1X-2 video adapter (Olympus America) and a 0.45Ã— camera coupler (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI).  Statistical Analysis  Overall survival was defined as the time a patient was diagnosed with a myeloid malignancy at Cleveland Clinic or Johns Hopkins to death or last known contact, and analyzed using Kaplan-Meier statistics and Cox&#x27;s proportional hazards model. For comparison of the frequency of clinical features between Cbl family mutation and wild-type (WT), categoric variables were analyzed using Fisher&#x27;s exact test.  Go to: RESULTS Detection of UPD11q Using SNP-A and Detection of c-Cbl Mutation  Previously, we identified homozygous c-Cbl mutations in patients with CMML and UPD11q.15 Using SNP-A karyotyping, we studied a large cohort of patients (n = 442) with MDS and related disorders, including JMML and CML blast crisis (CML-BC), to assess the frequency of this lesion within clinical subtypes. Three hundred one and 187 cases were examined by 250K and 6.0 arrays, respectively. Forty-six cases were analyzed using both arrays, yielding identical results. Based on the analysis of 1,003 controls, we determined the average size and location of nonclonal regions of autozygosity. All of these nonclonal regions were interstitial. For the purpose of this study, we have excluded all regions of autozygosity based on the size criteria (27 Mb) derived from controls. The remaining regions were confirmed by analysis of germ-line samples (nonclonal CD3+ lymphocytes) in 45 patients (Fig 1A). Regions of homozygosity found in both bone marrow and CD3+ fractions were excluded from further analyses. We confirmed UPD11q detected on 250K arrays by repeated analyses using ultra-high density Affymetrix 6.0 arrays and Genotyping Console version 2.0 software (Fig 1B). Among a total of 133 regions of somatic UPD on multiple chromosomes including 1, 4, 17, and 21, UPD11q was most common (n = 17). LOH can also result from deletions, and deletions involving 11q23.3 were found in 29 patients (Fig 1C). Sequencing c-Cbl revealed mutations in 13 cases (76%) of UPD11q. However, among patients with deletion11q, a c-Cbl mutation was found in only one case (CMML). We also analyzed patients without LOH11q to assess the frequency of heterozygous mutations and identified five cases (1.2%).  Fig 1 Fig 1 Detecting acquired, segmental uniparental disomy (UPD) using single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) technology. (A) SNP-A karyograms of both whole bone marrow (BM) cells and CD3+ lymphocytes of a patient show the somatic nature of acquired UPD in ... c-Cbl Mutations and Clinical Features  We sequenced all exons of c-Cbl; all mutations, except for 1 frame shift mutation in the tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain, were associated with the RFD or linker sequence, which are highly conserved among species. More importantly, 12 mutations in the RFD were located at or next to a cysteine residue (63%; Fig 2). The presence of each somatic mutation was confirmed by bidirectional DNA sequencing of multiple isolates and comparison against CD3+ sorted lymphocytes when possible.  Fig 2. Fig 2. Identification of variations in c-Cbl, Cbl-b and Cbl-c RING finger (RF) domain. Schematic representation shows the major domains of c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c, primarily the tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, linker sequence (L), RF domain, proline-rich ... In one case of a patient with MDS (refractory anemia subtype) and monosomy 7 who transformed to AML, SNP-A karyotyping revealed the UPD11q, yet after transformation to AML sequencing identified a c-Cbl mutation creating a novel splice site resulting in a longer transcript (Appendix Fig A1, online only). We also found a hemizygous mutation in the linker sequence in a CMML patient with a microdeletion of 11q23.3 previously undetected by metaphase cytogenetics (Appendix Fig A2, online only). Eleven mutations were found in CMML and similar forms of MDS/MPN unclassifiable either at or before the time of testing; 6 of these patients progressed to sAML (55%). In total, two (5%) of 38 patients with CMML, 10 (9%) of 110 with sAML, and one (1%) of 115 patients with MDS carried mutant c-Cbl (Appendix Table A2, online only). In addition, c-Cbl mutations were found in four (19%) of 21 patients with JMML and one (10%) of 10 with CML-BC.  Other Mutations and Nonsynonimous SNPs in Related E3 Ubiquitin Ligases  The Cbl family contains several other E3 ligases, including Cbl-b (3q) and Cbl-c (19q) as well as a novel member with high homology called Hakai (7q). Based on structural and functional similarities we hypothesized that these genes can also harbor mutations associated with similar clinical phenotypes. When we sequenced 12 patients with corresponding UPDs, no mutations were found. However, when we sequenced all patients in our cohort without c-Cbl mutations, we identified three with a heterozygous and one with a hemizygous Cbl-b mutation (Appendix Fig A3, online only) and three patients (one cell line) with a Cbl-c frame shift polymorphism with a single base insertion, all affecting the RFD (Fig 2). In addition, we identified 12 (7%) of 167 patients with myeloid malignancies harboring another rare nonsynonymous SNP in Cbl-c, also affecting the RFD (H405Y). The frequency of this SNP in the general population is less than 1% (data not shown).  Clinical Characteristics in Patients With Cbl Family Mutation  In order to identify the pathologic subtypes in which Cbl family member mutations may play a role, we systematically investigated a wide range of myeloid malignancies. They were most commonly associated with MDS/MPN subentities, including CMML and atypical MDS/MPN, and some cases of typical MDS. In addition, Cbl family mutations appear to be present in sAML with an antecedent history of MDS/MPN. Based on this distribution of c-Cbl mutations, we analyzed other related disease entities within MDS/MPN and MPN; we also identified c-Cbl mutations in JMML and in CML-BC (Appendix Table A2). This pattern suggests that c-Cbl mutations can be a characteristic feature of atypical MDS/MPN syndromes or serve as a second genetic hit facilitating malignant evolution. Our study demonstrates the ubiquitous nature of Cbl family mutations, in particular in the context of very circumscribed phenotypes of myelomonocytic neoplasms.  Several common clinical features were identified among 27 patients affected by the Cbl family of variants, including monoblast or monocyte proliferation (74%), splenomegaly (81%), and surface expression of c-kit on malignant cells (93%). Characteristic nuclear features included abnormal lobulation and hyperchromatic and raisinoid nuclei of megakaryocytes seen in patients with CMML (Appendix Fig A4, online only). By immunohistochemistry, c-Cbl mutant megakaryocyte nuclei displayed aberrant pSTAT5 staining (86%; Appendix Fig A4), while pSTAT5 was not expressed in patients without c-Cbl mutations. In three cases, pSTAT5 expression was not detected in specimens obtained before the mutation was present (Appendix Fig A4). The clinical phenotype of patients with Cbl-b mutations was not distinguishable from that of patients with c-Cbl mutations. The allelic pattern of Cbl family mutations plays an important role in disease phenotype in patients; in sAML eight (62%) of 13 c-Cbl family mutations were homozygous (Fig 3A).  Fig 3. Fig 3. Cbl family mutations in myeloid malignancies and unique clinical characteristics of patients with mutations. (A) Cbl family mutations are frequently observed in secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (sAML; 12%), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms ... To evaluate the impact of Cbl family mutations, we first compared mutant and WT cases on the basis of various clinical parameters (Table 1). In mutant cases, monocyte counts were significantly higher as compared with patients with WT Cbl family genes. A higher proportion of patients with c-Cbl mutations were treated with intense chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation, suggesting that these therapies were more frequently selected because of the aggressive biology of the Cbl mutation-associated disease. When we performed univariate analysis of survival impact of various clinical variables, significant differences in WBC, monocyte counts, disease risk, and the presence of Cbl family gene mutations (Table 2) were found. Chemotherapy was an adverse risk factor for survival, likely as it correlated with more advanced disease in multivariate analyses. The prognosis of patients with Cbl family mutations was poor, especially in those with homozygous mutations. The median overall survival was 5 months for all patients, with a significant difference of 1.7 months versus 20 months for patients with homozygous and heterozygous mutations, respectively (P = .04; Fig 3B). In multivariate analyses advanced disease (hazard ratio [HR], 5.64; 95% CI, 3.8 to 8.36) and Cbl family mutations (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.18 to 4.02; Table 3) were shown to be independent adverse factors for overall survival.  Table 1. Table 1. Comparison of Clinical Characteristics Between Wild-Type and Mutant Cbl Family Genes Table 2. Table 2. Univariate Analysis of Overall Survival in Clinical Variables Table 3. Table 3. Multivariate Analysis of Overall Survival in Clinical Variables Go to: DISCUSSION In leukemia, cytogenetic abnormalities identify underlying pathophysiology and carry enormous prognostic and therapeutic significance. Various examples of gain of function and inactivating mutations show that homologous recombination may lead to duplication of affected alleles.24 Consequently, areas of somatic UPD may point toward genes carrying putative pathogenic mutations. When high density SNP-A was applied as a karyotyping platform in a large number of patients with MDS and related disorders, we noted recurrent somatic UPD at chromosome 11q, particularly frequent in MDS/MPN. Commonly deleted region mapping and analysis of genes located within this region led us to hypothesize that c-Cbl may contain mutations. Sequencing of c-Cbl in patients affected by somatic UPD11q revealed RFD and linker sequence mutations present in patients with CMML, MDS/ MPN unclassifiable, and sAML derived from these conditions or MDS. We also found new mutations in Cbl-b with a clinical phenotype similar to that seen with c-Cbl RFD mutations. Consequently, our results imply that E3 ubiquitin ligases constitute a novel class of genes in whom mutations reflect a novel general mechanism of leukemogenesis. This notion is supported by the variety of pathomorphologic subentities of myeloid malignancies affected by mutations of the Cbl family. Moreover, a novel frame shift polymorphism was found in Cbl-c in patients with MDS/MPN. However, the relevance of this otherwise extremely rare polymorphism is not clear as the corresponding gene does not show significant expression in myeloid cells.  Cas-Br-M, a retrovirus, contains v-Cbl which corresponds to about one third of the murine c-Cbl gene and contains only the murine phosphotyrosine binding domain.25 This virus consistently induces a type of pre-B cell lymphoma in infected mice. The importance of c-Cbl in hematopoiesis has been previously demonstrated in knockout mice that show hyper-responsiveness to hematopoietic growth factors, expansion of the progenitor and stem cell pool, and mild myeloproliferative features.17 However, recent results obtained with an RFD knock-in in a c-Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ mouse model parallels the phenotype observed in patients; the mutant mouse demonstrated a severe myeloproliferative phenotype (W.Y. Langdon, personal communication). Indeed, in patients mutations were predominantly located in the RFD and affected structurally essential cysteines, possibly led to inactivation of RFD function by frame shift, or created novel splicing sites resulting in larger transcripts. In addition, c-Cbl mutations were homozygous or hemizygous, implying that the presence of a WT allele is protective. It is likely that mutations do not lead to the simple knockout of c-Cbl function. Rather, by affecting the RFD, they render it a proto-oncogene, consistent with the oncogenic properties of v-Cbl. Previously, mutations of c-Cbl have been described in a limited number of patients with AML, but neither their function nor their clinical phenotype could be delineated without a comprehensive study of corresponding karyotypes and clinical outcomes.26â€“28  c-Cbl is a member of the Cbl family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which poly- or monoubiquitinate a number of important tyrosine kinases serving as important transduction elements of proliferative signals and activated tyrosine kinase receptors, including Flt-3, c-kit, and M-CSF.29,30 Consequently, inactivation of ubiquitination may lead to enhanced and prolonged signaling, a function which can explain the phenotype in patients (Fig 4). Based on this essential role of E3 ligases, we hypothesized that another Cbl family member, Cbl-b, may also be affected by mutations in myeloid malignancies. Sequencing of these genes in patients who did not harbor c-Cbl mutations revealed that these genes can also be affected by mutations leading to the inactivation of the RFD. These patients displayed a clinical phenotype analogous to those with c-Cbl mutations. The clinical features corresponding to c-Cbl mutations included monocytic features, aberrant and increased phosphorylation of pSTAT5, and monocytoid blasts. An increased frequency of mutations in patients with frank AML may argue either that c-Cbl mutations lead to an invariant progression to an aggressive phenotype, or that they constitute a second hit event frequently occurring in the context of atypical myeloproliferative disorders. In fact, unlike other reports that looked at patients with inv16, we found no mutation of Cbl family genes in de novo AML, including French-American-British type M4 or M5.28 Both theories are supported by the dismal prognosis of patients with Cbl family mutations. The close association of c-Cbl mutations with monocyte expansion, such as that seen in JMML, CMML, or sAML with monocytoid features, suggests a primary role of c-Cbl mutations in the pathogenesis of these diseases, while occurrence of c-Cbl mutations during evolution to AML in serially studied patients and the high proportion of cases with advanced leukemia affected by c-Cbl mutations argues for its auxiliary facilitator role.  Fig 4. Fig 4. Potential intracellular consequences of c-Cbl mutations. c-Cbl is a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl family, which poly- or monoubiquitinate a number of important receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), including Flt-3, c-kit, and CSF-1, for degradation. ... Taken together, our data suggests that Cbl family mutations constitute a novel class of pathogenic molecular lesions associated with a spectrum of myeloid malignancies characterized by myeloproliferative features and poor prognosis. Inactivation of the RFD, and thereby ubiquitination involved in downmodulation of proliferative signaling, constitutes a general mechanism of leukemogenesis likely present in a variety of malignancies.

Cbl-c gene is not known to be expressed in myeloid malignancies. â€ Cell line from a patient with secondary AML (sAML).  Despite the discovery of the p.V617F in JAK2, the molecular pathogenesis of some chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms remains unclear. Although very rare, different studies have identified CBL (Cas-Br-Murine ecotropic retroviral transforming sequence) mutations in V617FJAK2-negative patients, mainly located in the RING finger domain. In order to determine the frequency of CBL mutations in these diseases, we studied different regions of all CBL family genes (CBL, CBLB and CBLC) in a selected group of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. We also included V617FJAK2-positive patients to check whether mutations in CBL and JAK2 are mutually exclusive events.  Design and Methods  Using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography, we screened for mutations in CBL, CBLB and CBLC in a group of 172 V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms not selected for loss of heterozygosity. The effect on cell proliferation of the mutations detected was analyzed on a 32D(FLT3) cell model.  Results  An initial screening of all coding exons of CBL, CBLB and CBLC in 44 V617FJAK2-negative samples revealed two new CBL mutations (p.C416W in the RING finger domain and p.A678V in the proline-rich domain). Analyses performed on 128 additional V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive samples detected three CBL changes (p.T402HfsX29, p.P417R and p.S675C in two cases) in four V617FJAK2-positive patients. None of these mutations was found in 200 control samples. Cell proliferation assays showed that all of the mutations promoted hypersensitivity to interleukin-3 in 32D(FLT3) cells.  Conclusions  Although mutations described to date have been found in the RING finger domain and in the linker region of CBL, we found a similar frequency of mutations in the proline-rich domain. In addition, we found CBL mutations in both V617FJAK2-positive (4/232; 1.7%) and negative (2/172; 1.2%) patients and all of them promoted hypersensitivity to interleukin-3.  Keywords: CBL, MPN, mutation analysis Go to: Introduction BCR-ABL1-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematologic malignancies characterized by abnormal proliferation and survival of one or more myeloid lineage cells. In some cases these diseases evolve to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These hematologic neoplasms include both classic MPN [essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF)] and atypical MPN (such as chronic eosinophilic leukemia, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, hypereosinophilic syndrome, mast cell disease and myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia, among others).1  In the late 1990s some genetic aberrations were described as molecular disease-causing events in these neoplasms, most of them via fusion genes resulting from reciprocal chromosomal translocations. Such fusions activate tyrosine kinases, playing a role similar to ABL1 in chronic myeloid leukemia.2,3 However these fusions are very rare and most of them have been reported in one or two cases worldwide.4  This situation changed in 2005 with the description of the p.V617F mutation (valine to phenylalanine in amino acid 617) in JAK2, found not only in classic MPN but also in a small number of atypical MPN and other myeloid neoplasms.5 Furthermore, it was found that most of the V617FJAK2-negative cases of PV had other transforming mutations in exon 12 of JAK2. Other gain-of-function mutations have also been described in genes coding for JAK-STAT receptors, such as MPL or EPOR in familial and sporadic cases of MPN.6â€“10 However, to date it is not known whether these mutations cause the full phenotype or whether they cooperate with other still uncharacterized mutations. Thus, there is still a significant proportion of patients in whom the molecular disease-causing event remains to be discovered.  Recently, the application of single nucleotide polymorphism and comparative genomic hybridization array technologies has led to the identification of new mutations in loss of heterozygosity regions affecting genes such as TET2,11 ASXL1,12 IKZF1,13 RUNX1,14 IDH1 and IDH2,15 EZH2,16 NF1,17 and CBL.18â€“23  CBL (11q23) codes for a protein of the Cbl family of E3-ubiquitin ligases (CBL, CBLB and CBLC) that acts as a negative regulator of some cell signaling pathways, by promoting the ubiquitination of several signaling molecules including some tyrosine kinases. CBL proteins share a common structure, with a highly conserved tyrosine kinase-binding domain in the amino-terminal region that determines substrate specificity. The catalytic E3-ubiquitin ligase activity resides in the RING finger domain, which is separated from the tyroskine kinase binding domain by a linker region. CBL and CBLB have two other domains that are not well conserved in CBLC: a proline-rich region involved in the recognition of SH3-proteins, and the carboxy-terminal UBA domain that interacts with ubiquitin molecules allowing dimer formation.24 CBL and CBLB play an important role in cell signaling in the majority of tissues, while CBLC activity seems to be restricted to epithelial cells.25â€“27  Over the last few years several groups have identified CBL mutations in different hematologic neoplasms, although most commonly in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/MPN such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.18â€“23,28â€“39 These changes cause the loss of E3-ubiquitin ligase activity, resulting in deregulation of downstream targets and an increase in cell proliferation rates. To our knowledge, CBL mutations seem to be mutually exclusive with other mutations frequently found in these diseases such as Ras mutations, FLT3-ITD or V617FJAK2. In this study we searched for mutations in CBL, CBLB and CBLC in a group of 172 V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive MPN patients not selected for loss of heterozygosity, using a denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) method. Although most of the mutations described previously have been found in the RING finger domain and in the linker region of CBL, we found novel mutations also in the proline-rich domain, both in V617FJAK2-positive and -negative patients.  Go to: Design and Methods Samples  Blood samples were collected from 404 different Caucasian MPN patients without the BCR-ABL1 fusion from several hospitals from the north of Spain. Informed consent was obtained from individual patients and the study was approved by the internal Ethics Committee. The first series of patients included 44 with V617FJAK2-negative MPN (4 diagnosed as PV, 15 as ET, 4 as PMF and 21 as atypical MPN). Later, a second series of 128 V617FJAK2-negative MPN patients (16 PV, 81 ET and 31 PMF) and 232 V617FJAK2-positive MPN patients (69 PV, 149 ET and 14 PMF) were included. The presence/absence of V617FJAK2 mutation was determined in all patients by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR).40 In addition, all 404 samples were negative for the presence of MPL p.W515 mutations by dHPLC. Human leukemia cell lines HEL, M07e, UKE-1 and SET-2 were also included in the study (Table 1).  Table 1. Table 1. Frequency of CBL mutations found in our series. Initial mutational screening by dHPLC included 20 healthy (no disease) samples used as controls in order to check the frequency of sequence changes observed in our population. For those fragments in which we found sequence variants in patients, we also included 180 additional control samples in order to rule out that the changes detected were population polymorphisms.  Cell lines  Cell proliferation assays were performed on 32Dcl3 (32D) murine myeloid cells (DSMZ N. ACC411) incubated at 37ÂºC in 5% CO2 and maintained in 90% RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 10 ng/mL murine interleukin-3 (Recombinant Mouse IL3, Cat #PMC0035, GibcoÂ®, Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK).  Plasmids  Plasmids with tagged human open reading frames in pCMV6-AC-GFP vectors were purchased from Origene Technologies (Cat #RG214069 for CBL, RG206047 for CBLB and RG205130 for CBLC). The tagged human cDNA clone for FLT3 was also purchased from Origene Technologies as pCMV6-Entry vector (Cat #RC211459) and subcloned into pCMV6-AC-RFP vector (Cat #PS100034). These pCMV6-AC vectors carried the NeoR gene. The pCMVâ€“HA ubiquitin vector was a gift from Dr. Francis Grand from Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory (Salisbury, UK).  Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography analysis  Genomic DNA was obtained from all the samples and amplified with GenomiPhi v2.0 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) in order to obtain enough material for mutational screening. All mutations were confirmed using the original unamplified sample and no discrepancies were observed with whole-genome amplified DNA.  We designed primers with Primer341 to amplify all coding exons of the three screened genes (CBL, CBLB and CBLC) in flanking introns. For each fragment we also designed a mutant primer introducing a nucleotide change in the forward or reverse primer, depending on the corresponding melting profile, to create a control mutated fragment to validate each dHPLC assay. Melting profiles for PCR fragments, solvent gradients and temperature conditions were calculated by Navigatorâ„¢ Software v1.6.2 (Transgenomic Ltd., Omaha, NE, USA) and validated experimentally. All the analyses were performed on a WAVEÂ® 4500HT System (Transgenomic Ltd., Omaha, NE, USA) with a DNASepÂ® HT cartridge. Online Supplementary Table S1 contains a list of primers, the sizes of the amplified fragments and dHPLC conditions.  PCR reactions were performed with AmpliTaqâ„¢ Gold (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using standard protocols. After cycling, samples were subjected to several cycles of heating and cooling in order to create heteroduplex molecules to improve mutation detection by dHPLC. For each fragment, we sequenced two samples of each different elution profile. Results were analyzed with Mutation Surveyor v3.10 (SoftGenetics LLC, State College, PA, USA) and compared to genomic reference sequences (ENSG00000110395 for CBL, ENSG00000114423 for CBLB and ENSG00000142273 for CBLC).  All coding exons of CBL, CBLB and CBLC were initially analyzed in a group of 44 V617FJAK2-negative patients (4 PV, 4 PMF, 15 ET and 21 atypical MPN). In light of the results we analyzed the RING finger domain coding exons (exons 8 and 9 from CBL, exons 9 and 10 from CBLB and exons 7 and 8 from CBLC) in 128 V617FJAK2-negative (16 PV, 31 PMF, 81 ET) and in 232 V617FJAK2-positive MPN (69 PV, 14 PMF, 149 ET), as well as in human leukemia cell lines M07e, HEL, SET-2 and UKE-1. We also included CBL exon 12 in this extended analysis because we observed a p.A678V change in one sample from the initial series.  CBL exon 8 deletions  Some of the mutations described for CBL are large deletions involving exon 8 (RING finger domain)18,21â€“23,29,30,32,37,42 and the design of our mutation screening assay was not able to detect some of them. We, therefore, designed a new PCR assay with primers located in exon 7 and intron 9 (E7Fw: 5â€™-TCCTGATGGAC-GAAATCAGA-3â€™; E9-Rv: 5â€™-CTCACAATGGATTTTGCCAGT-3â€™) which would amplify a normal fragment of 989 bp. With this assay, any large deletion of exon 8 would be detected as a product of smaller size.  Site-directed mutagenesis  All missense mutations detected for each gene were functionally tested. Mutants p.R420Q (used as the control mutant), p.C416W, p.P417R, p.T402HfsX29, p.S675C and p.A678V for CBL; p.R462W for CBLB and p.Q419PfsX81, p.P435S and p.E392K for CBLC were obtained using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA, USA) from the original plasmids.  Transfection  Transfections were performed with Amaxa NucleofectorÂ® Device II technology (Lonza Cologne GmbH, Basel, Switzerland) according to standard protocols. Cells of the 32D cell line in exponential growth were first transfected with FLT3 vector and maintained in medium until a second CBL/Ubi transfection. From the first transfection with FLT3 vector, cells were grown with Geneticin (G-418 sulfate, Cat #11811 GibcoÂ®, Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK) to select those clones that had incorporated the vector.  Cell proliferation assays  Proliferation analysis was performed with the CellTiter 96Â® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS, Ref #G3580, Promega Corp, Madison, WI, USA) according to standard protocols, comparing cells transfected with wild-type CBL (CBL, CBLB or CBLC in each case) with cells transfected with mutant CBL during 3 or 4 days, in triplicate. In each case we carried out four different experiments, also including 32D(FLT3) cells transfected with pCMV6-AC-GFP and mock-transfected 32D(FLT3) cells as controls. In all cases cells were supplemented with 10 ng/mL recombinant human FLT3-ligand (Cat #GF038, Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA) and with 10 ng/mL murine interleukin-3 (Recombinant Mouse IL3, Cat #PMC0035, GibcoÂ®, Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK). As the positive mutant control we used p.R420Q, a previously described CBL mutant with an effect on cell proliferation.28  Statistical analysis  Results from MTS proliferation assays were compared using the Studentâ€™s t-test implemented in UNStat (a free tool available at http://www.unav.es/departamento/genetica/unstat).  Go to: Results Mutational screening  In the initial screening of all coding exons of CBL, CBLB and CBLC in 44 patients with V617FJAK2-negative MPN we detected two missense changes not previously described in CBL (2/44; 4.5%). In this first series we also found three missense changes in CBLC described as single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs35457630, rs3208856, rs116023028) in the RING finger domain and proline-rich region. These changes were detected in samples from both patients and controls. No missense changes were detected in CBLB.  CBL changes (p.C416W or g.72251T&amp;gt;G and p.A678V or g.81664C&amp;gt;T) were found in patients diagnosed with atypical MPN, although the disease in the patient with p.A678V later evolved to CMML because of the development of dysplastic features. Whereas p.C416W affected the RING finger domain, like other mutations previously reported, p.A678V was located in exon 12, which codes for the proline-rich domain of CBL (see Figure 1). For this reason, we decided to include this exon in the analysis of CBL in an additional group of patients.  Figure 1. Figure 1. (A) CBL mutations described to date in myeloid malignancies. Mutations found in our analysis are colored in red. In contrast to other studies in which mutations were found in the linker region (LR) and the RING finger domain, we also found two novel changes ... When we analyzed exon 12 of CBL and the RING finger domains of CBL, CBLB and CBLC in the additional series of samples (128 V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive patients), we found three CBL changes in four V617FJAK2-positive patients (4/232, 1.7%). The first one (detected in a patient with ET) was a not previously reported g.71955_71955A deletion in exon 8. This is a frameshift change that truncates the RING finger domain with loss of the proline-rich and UBA carboxy-terminal domains (p.T402HfsX29) (Figure 1). The second change was a substitution g.72253C&amp;gt;G (p.P417R) in exon 9 in a patient diagnosed with PMF, also affecting the RING finger domain and previously identified in a patient with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.37 Finally, the third CBL mutation was a not previously reported g.81655C&amp;gt;G substitution (p.S675C) in exon 12 (proline-rich region). Remarkably, this change was detected in two different V617FJAK2-positive patients, one with ET and the other with PV. None of the 200 control samples analyzed showed any of these changes. CBL exon 8 deletions were not observed in any case.  We also detected a not previously reported substitution (g.149486C&amp;gt;T, p.R462W) in the RING finger domain of CBLB in a sample from a V617FJAK2-positive patient with PV (1/232; 0.4%). In CBLC, we detected one frameshift change (g.15702_15703insC, p.Q419PfsX81), in a patient with V617FJAK2-negative PV, which has been described as a polymorphism (rs66944506).  None of the cell lines included in these analyses (HEL, SET-2, UKE-1 and M07e) showed any CBL, CBLB or CBLC mutation.  CBL mutations promote hypersensitivity to interleukin-3 in 32D(FLT3) cells  A significantly higher number of cells was observed in 32D(FLT3) cells transfected with CBL mutants than with wild-type CBL (P&amp;lt;0.05, Figure 2), grouping data from four independent cell proliferation assays. In addition, cells transfected with mutant vectors showed significantly higher proliferation rates in all cases (P&amp;lt;0.05, Figure 2) and with stronger effects than those observed for the p.R420Q control mutation.  Figure 2. Figure 2. (A to F) All missense mutations detected in CBL were functionally tested. Left, results of cell proliferation assays corresponding to four different transfections for each mutation. Two transfection controls (cells mock-transfected and cells transfected ... By contrast, assays for p.R462W in CBLB and for p.Q419PfsX81, p.E392K and p.P435S in CBLC (Online Supplementary Figure S1) showed no significant differences (P&amp;gt;0.05) in proliferation rates.  Go to: Discussion In the last few years the detection of regions with acquired loss of heterozygosity in some patients, mainly caused by acquired uniparental disomy, has allowed the identification of candidate genes that may be mutated in myeloid neoplasms. One of these genes is CBL, which codes for an E3-ubiquitin ligase protein. Cbl family proteins (CBL, CBLB and CBLC) play an important role as regulators of several signaling pathways promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of some RTK and CTK,44 many of which are involved in these diseases.4,45,46  The first CBL mutation identified was p.R420Q, affecting the RING finger domain in a patient with AML.28 Subsequently, other mutations have been reported with variable frequencies in myeloid neoplasms, affecting not only the RING finger domain but also the linker region (Figure 1). These events have been observed in 1â€“33% cases of secondary AML, 1â€“7% of MPN and 2â€“33% of MDS/MPN and AML,18â€“23,28â€“39 but their frequencies could be as high as 85â€“90% in patients with loss of heterozygosity in 11q.18â€“20,22,23,33 Some reports have also described that 7% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer have CBL mutations, so this gene can be mutated in other types of tumor.47 CBLB mutations and CBLC missense polymorphisms affecting the RING finger domain have also been described in myeloid neoplasms but at a lower frequency and with unknown effects.22,23,29  In this study we searched for mutations in CBL, CBLB and CBLC in a cohort of 404 V617FJAK2-negative and -positive MPN patients not selected for the presence of loss of heterozygosity in 11q. Our results show that CBL is mutated in V617FJAK2-negative MPN at a frequency similar to that previously reported (p.C416W and p.A678V; 1.2%, 2/172, Table 1).49 Both patients with mutations were initially diagnosed as having atypical MPN (2/21; 9.5%), although in one of them the disease evolved to CMML due to the development of dysplastic features. CMML is the disease with the highest frequency of CBL mutations reported to date.18â€“20,22,34 None of these mutations had been previously described and, notably, p.A678V was located in the proline-rich domain. In V617JAK2-positive MPN we found two mutations affecting the RING finger domain (p.T402HfsX29 in a patient with ET and p.P417R in a patient with PMF) and a recurrent change in the proline-rich domain (p.S675C in a patient with ET and in another one with PV) of CBL. Although TET2, ASXL1 and JAK2 mutations have been found concurrently,50 CBL mutations and V617FJAK2 seemed to be mutually exclusive events.13,21,26,51 However, we have found a similar frequency of CBL mutations in both V617FJAK2-positive and V617FJAK2-negative patients (Table 1), suggesting that the prevalence of CBL mutations could increase if V617FJAK2-positive patients were also included in CBL mutational studies. Unfortunately, we cannot know whether both mutations are in the same or in different clones or whether they are monoallelic or biallelic because of the type of sample available. None of the V617FJAK2-positive cell lines analyzed (HEL, SET-2 and UKE-1) showed CBL mutations that might help us to elucidate how both events could cooperate to drive the disease.43  In order to determine the effect of all these mutations on cell proliferation, in vitro functional assays were performed. All CBL mutations induced a hyperproliferative response to interleukin-3 in the 32D(FLT3) model, similar to that induced by the well-characterized p.R420Q mutation.28,31 This effect was not observed for the mutations detected in CBLB and CBLC. CBL was initially described as a putative tumor suppressor gene because of its negative regulatory function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Most of the mutations reported are located in conserved residues of the linker region and RING finger domain and could impair this regulatory function.44,46,52 RING finger domain mutations p.T402HfsX29, p.C416W and p.P417R described in this work also affect conserved residues of the protein (Figure 3) with a similar effect on the loss of activity of CBL.  Figure 3. Figure 3. Evolutionary conservation of the CBL regions in which mutations have been detected. Sequence comparison between humans (Homo sapiens) and other mammals (Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Pan troglodytes, Bos taurus, Macaca mulatta and Equus caballus) in ... Notably, we found two additional, novel mutations (one of them recurrent) affecting conserved residues in the pro-line-rich region (p.A678V and p.S675C, Figure 3) which also promote cell proliferation. In fact, we found similar frequencies of mutations in RING finger and proline-rich domains. The proline-rich region is essential for the interaction of CBL with the adaptor proteins (such as Grb2 and FRs2Î±) needed to maintain a stable attachment between CBL and its substrate,52 with proteins involved in the endocytosis of target receptors (such as SH3KBP1)46 and with several signaling proteins (such as the Src family).46  As in previous studies, we observed that mock-transfected cells showed greater growth than cells transfected with wild-type CBL, but less than cells transfected with mutant CBL. This fact is concordant with the proposal by some authors of a dominant negative effect of CBL mutant forms on endogenous wild-type CBL, making it unable to perform its negative regulatory function and promoting intracellular signaling and higher cell proliferation rates.18,26,27 However, in vivo studies have shown that the presence of gain-of-function mutants with a dominant effect over endogenous CBL is not enough to develop a myeloproliferative disease.18,26,27 A possible explanation for this phenomenon could be the activity of wild-type CBL as a positive regulator of cell growth contributing to the activation of pathways such as PI3K, Ras/MAPK and Src.52,53 Under normal conditions, the negative regulatory activity of CBL could mask its activity as a positive regulator, but the lack of E3-ubiquitin ligase activity could reveal its signaling enhancing activity.27 This could be the reason for the non-transforming effect of the p.R462W CBLB mutant in 32D(FLT3) cells. CBLB does not show the positive regulatory effects of CBL52 and perhaps the loss of its E3-ubiquitin ligase activity is not enough to promote cell proliferation. In fact, although CBLB activity seems to be similar to that of CBL in hematologic cells, very few cases of myeloid neoplasms with CBLB mutations have been reported.25,29  Finally, the results obtained in CBLC suggest that missense single nucleotide polymorphisms do not increase cell proliferation in our model. Wild-type CBLC induced higher proliferation rates in 32D(FLT3) cells than wild-type CBL in all assays (Online Supplementary Figure S1) possibly due to the absence of an inhibitory role of CBLC in hematologic cells.25,54,55  In conclusion, we have identified mutations in the proline-rich region of CBL in patients with MPN and also in V617FJAK2-positive patients. Although the entire CBL coding sequence has been investigated in some studies (by sequencing, not by dHPLC),18,19,22,32 most research in recent years has focused only on exons coding for the linker region and RING finger domain20,21,23,28,30,31,33â€“36,38 and in patients without other frequent genetic aberrations, such as mutations in JAK2.26 Proline-rich domain mutations (p.S675C and p.A678V) confer hypersensitivity to cytokines in the 32D(FLT3) model in a similar way to RING finger domain mutations (p.T402HfsX29, p.C416W and p.P427R), suggesting that they should also be considered in analyses of CBL. Although these events seem to be rare in MPN, our data highlight the importance of reevaluating the prevalence of CBL mutations in other regions of the gene in myeloid neoplasms. This could be of special interest in MDS/MPN because of the high incidence of CBL mutations in these diseases. In addition, further functional analyses of these genetic events could help us to understand the cellular functions of CBL and the role of the different protein domains. It is well known that CBL activity is mediated by the activation of different RTK, so the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as anti-FLT3) or other signal transduction inhibitors could also be effective in the treatment of patients with CBL mutations.27,32,56&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;Abstract Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is characterized by hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). SHP2, NF-1, KRAS, and NRAS are mutated in JMML patients, leading to aberrant regulation of RAS signaling. A subset of JMML patients harbor CBL mutations associated with 11q acquired uniparental disomy. Many of these mutations are in the linker region and the RING finger of CBL, leading to a loss of E3 ligase activity. We investigated the mechanism by which CBL-Y371H, a linker region mutant, and CBL-C384R, a RING finger mutant, lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling. Expression of CBL mutants in the TF-1 cell line resulted in enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF. Cells expressing CBL mutations displayed increased phosphorylation of GM-CSF receptor Î²c subunit in response to stimulation, although expression of total GM-CSFR Î²c was lower. This suggested enhanced kinase activity downstream of GM-CSFR. JAK2 and LYN kinase expression is elevated in CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutant cells, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of CBL and S6 in response to GM-CSF stimulation. Incubation with the JAK2 inhibitor, TG101348, abolished the increased phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in cells expressing CBL mutants, whereas treatment with the SRC kinase inhibitor dasatinib resulted in equalization of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation signal between wild type CBL and CBL mutant samples. Dasatinib treatment inhibited the elevated phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants. Our study indicates that CBL linker and RING finger mutants lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling due to elevated kinase expression, which can be blocked using small molecule inhibitors targeting specific downstream pathways.

In order to mediate its functional activity, GM-CSF binds to its receptor, the GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR),2 consisting of GM-CSR Î± and GM-CSFR Î² common (Î²c) subunits. The Î²c subunit of the receptor is shared by the IL-3 and IL-5 receptors. Î²c is the major signaling subunit and is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to cytokine stimulation. Î²c phosphorylation results in the recruitment of various effectors leading to activation of downstream signaling (2â€“4). GM-CSFR Î± is the major binding subunit, which dictates the binding specificity of the receptor complex for GM-CSF (2, 4, 5). The engagement of GM-CSFR by GM-CSF results in the formation of a dodecameric complex of GM-CSFÂ·GM-CSFR Î±Â·GM-CSFR Î²c, which leads to the trans-phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c-associated JAK2 kinases (6). The activated JAK2 kinases phosphorylate GM-CSFR Î²c tyrosine residues, allowing for the recruitment of various effectors and the activation of downstream signaling. GM-CSF stimulation results in the activation of the JAK-STAT, PI3K, and the RAS/MAPK pathways, contributing to GM-CSF-mediated differentiation, proliferation, and survival (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 4).  GM-CSF hypersensitivity is one of the defining characteristics of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). This disease is classified by the World Health Organization as a mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease (7). JMML patients must show persistent monocytosis in the absence of the BCR-ABL oncogene (8). Genetic lesions deregulating the RAS signaling pathway have been identified to lead to JMML pathogenesis. 10â€“15% of JMML patients harbor mutations in neurofibromin protein (NF1) (9, 10), a GTPase-activating protein, which negatively regulates RAS by enhancing the hydrolysis of the active GTP-bound conformation of RAS to the inactive GDP-bound form (11). 35% of JMML patients have mutations in SHP2 (12â€“14), a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that positively regulates the RAS signaling pathway (15, 16). RAS-activating mutations account for another 20â€“25% of JMML-associated mutations (17â€“19). Several groups determined that a proportion of JMML patients have 11q uniparental disomy. CBL mutations were identified upon further analysis of the 11q uniparental disomy samples (20â€“22). The presence of NF1, SHP2, RAS, and CBL mutations are mutually exclusive, raising the question of how CBL mutations can lead to disease development.  CBL mutations have been identified in numerous other myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic, myeloproliferative, and mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease (23â€“28). The majority of these mutations localize to the CBL linker region or the RING finger. CBL is a ubiquitin E3 ligase, which specifies target proteins for ubiquitination. The linker region and RING finger of CBL play very important roles in its E3 ligase functionality. The linker region contains two conserved tyrosine residues, Tyr-368 and Tyr-371, whose phosphorylation activates and positively regulates E3 ligase activity of CBL (29â€“31). The CBL RING finger is responsible for recruiting active E2s carrying an ubiquitin moiety, allowing for the transfer of ubiquitin to the target substrate (29, 32). Therefore, it is not surprising that mutations in the linker region and RING finger of CBL identified in myeloid malignancies result in a loss of E3 ligase activity.  JMML is associated with GM-CSF hypersensitivity; however, there is a lack of evidence that specifically examines the role of CBL downstream of the GM-CSF receptor and how JMML-associated CBL mutations may affect GM-CSF signaling. CBL is known to become phosphorylated downstream of the Î²c in response to stimulation by IL-3 (33, 34) and GM-CSF (35, 36). Furthermore, CBL associates with the Î²c subunit upon IL-5 stimulation (37). However, these studies do not directly address the role of CBL in GM-CSF signaling.  The objective of this study is to investigate how JMML-associated CBL mutations modulate GM-CSF signaling and lead to GM-CSF hypersensitivity. We expressed wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R in the human TF-1 hematopoietic cell line, which expresses the endogenous GM-CSF receptor at physiological levels (38). Upon GM-CSF stimulation, elevated phosphorylation of GM-CSF Î²c was observed, resulting from elevated JAK2 and LYN phosphorylation. Expression of CBL JMML mutants resulted in enhanced S6 phosphorylation and increased cell survival. Treatment with pharmacologic inhibitors delineated which proximal GM-CSF-dependent pathways are dependent on JAK2 and LYN activation. In summary, our data show that CBL JMML mutants result in enhanced GM-CSF signaling via modulation of JAK2 and LYN tyrosine kinases.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Constructs pMSCV-HA-CBL retroviral vectors were used to create JMML-associated CBL mutants. HA-tagged CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R were constructed using QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s protocol.  Retrovirus Production HEK 293T cells were plated onto 10-cm dishes (Sarstedt) and grown to around 75% confluence. The 293T cells were transiently transfected with pSV (Gag and Pol proteins) and pVSV-G (envelope protein) and pMSCV-GFP retroviral vectors expressing HA-wild type CBL, HA-CBL-Y371H, or HA-CBL-C384R using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as directed in the manufacturer&#x27;s protocol. Briefly, 4.5 Î¼g of pSV, 1.5 Î¼g of VSV-G, and 4.5 Î¼g of pMSCV-IRES-GFP-HA-CBL constructs were mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 in serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM H-21 for 20 min at room temperature. 293T cells were washed with serum-free DMEM H-21, and 4 ml of serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM H-21 was added to the cells. DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 mixture was added to the plated cells and incubated for 6 h at 37 Â°C. Transfection medium was removed from the cells, and 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum was added. Transfected 293T supernatant containing VSV-G pseudotyped virus carrying pMSCV-HA-CBL was collected at 48 and 72 h post-transfection.  Cell Lines and Culture TF-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 Î¼g of streptomycin/ml, and 2 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. In order to stably express wild type and mutant CBL, TF-1 cells were infected with VSV-G pseudotyped retrovirus carrying wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R constructs. TF-1 cells were suspended in retroviral supernatant supplemented with 8 ng/ml Polybrene and centrifuged in 50-ml tubes at 12,000 rpm for 75 min. TF-1 cells were resuspended in fresh retroviral Polybrene solution and incubated overnight in 6-well dishes at 37 Â°C. A final round of spinoculation with fresh retroviral supernatant was performed on day 2. TF-1 cells were allowed to expand for 48 h. GFP-positive infected TF-1 cells expressing HA-CBL constructs were purified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).  XTT Assay TF-1 cells were cytokine-depleted overnight, as described below. 2000 cells were transferred to each well of a 96-well plate in a final volume of 100 Î¼l of RPMI, 10% FCS with the indicated concentrations of GM-CSF. Plates were incubated at 37 Â°C for 48 h prior to the addition of 3 Î¼m phenazine methosulfate (Sigma) and 2 mg/ml XTT (Diagnostic Chemicals). The cells were incubated with the XTT/phenazine methosulfate solution for 6 h at 37 Â°C. The absorption of the reduction product at 450 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer plate reader.  Annexin V Flow Cytometric Analysis TF-1 cells were cytokine-depleted and maintained in cytokine-free media for 72 h. Cells were stained with annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s protocol (BD Pharmingen). Stained cells were analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer.  Cytokine Deprivation, Stimulation, and Lysis TF-1 cells were washed three times in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), Hanks&#x27; balanced salts; depleted in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum overnight at 37 Â°C; and then stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. Proteasomal and lysosomal degradation was inhibited by incubation of cells with 30 Î¼m MG132 (Calbiochem/Millipore) and 100 Î¼m chloroquine (Sigma), respectively, for 2 h prior to stimulation. JAK2 and LYN kinase activity was inhibited by treatment with 2 m TG101348 (generously provided by Dr. R. Levine) for 4 h or with 0.1 m dasatinib (gift from Dr. D. Hedley) for 2 h, respectively. TF-1 cells were stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF for the indicated times at 37 Â°C.  The cells were washed once in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), Hanks&#x27; balanced salts containing 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and supplemented with â€œcOmpleteâ€� protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). After 5 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 Ã— g for 5 min at 4 Â°C.  Antibodies The 4G10 phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibody and anti-ERK1/2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology/Millipore. Anti-IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSFR Î²c N-20 (used for immunoblotting) and K-17 (used for immunoprecipitations)), anti-Shp2, and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies specific for phospho-JAK2 (Tyr-1007/1008), JAK2, phospho-SRC family (Tyr-416), phospho-Ser-235/236 S6, and Lynp56 were acquired from Cell Signaling Technologies. An anti-phospho STAT5a/b antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc./Invitrogen. Anti-STAT5 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. The monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA antibody was acquired from Roche Applied Science.  Immunoprecipitations Antibodies along with a 50-Î¼l volume of protein A or protein G-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to 2 mg of lysates for an overnight incubation at 4 Â°C. The beads were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer. The immune complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for Western blotting.  Western Blotting Following the electrophoretic transfer of proteins to PVDF membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), the membranes were blocked at room temperature with 2.5% BSA (w/v) or 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl) with Tween 20 for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated with an optimal concentration of the primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 Â°C. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and incubated with the relevant HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30â€“60 min. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence with autoradiographic film (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For reprobing, membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 0.1 m Î²-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 Â°C; rinsed twice in TBST; and blocked in 2.5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline prior to primary antibody incubation. Western blots were scanned and quantified using ImageJ software. Quantified Western blots are presented as mean Â± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student&#x27;s t test.  Go to: RESULTS Enhanced and Prolonged Phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c in CBL Mutant-expressing Cells GM-CSF hypersensitivity is one of the hallmark features of JMML (39). We utilized the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line to investigate the role of JMML-associated CBL mutations in vitro. TF-1 cells endogenously express the GM-CSF receptor Î± (GM-CSFRÎ±) and the IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF receptor Î² common chain (GM-CSFR Î²c), and are responsive to GM-CSF. HA-tagged wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R mutants were stably expressed in TF-1 cells (Fig. 1A). All exogenous constructs showed high expression of CBL when compared with vector-infected cells (Fig. 1A). This is especially advantageous because studies have shown that expression of wild type CBL can rescue or mask the effects of CBL mutants (23, 40).  FIGURE 1. FIGURE 1. Enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSF receptor Î²c upon expression of CBL mutants. A, lysates from parental TF-1 cells as well as from TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were probed for CBL expression. IB, immunoblot. B ... Binding of GM-CSF to the GM-CSF receptor complex activates JAK2, leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c. In order to investigate the effects of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants on GM-CSF signaling, we examined the phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c after stimulation. TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were cytokine-depleted and stimulated with GM-CSF. GM-CSFR Î²c was immunoprecipitated from lysates and immunoblotted with the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Upon GM-CSF stimulation, cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9) show enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c compared with the wild type CBL controls (lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c was observed in CBL mutant samples.  CBL plays an important role in stimulation-induced endocytosis, trafficking, and degradation of numerous tyrosine kinase (29, 32) and cytokine receptors (41, 42). To determine whether expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants has an effect on the expression of the GM-CSFR Î²c, as well as its GM-CSF induced degradation, lysates collected from GM-CSF-stimulated TF-1 cells were probed for GM-CSFR Î²c. Because it is likely that CBL-Y371H (23, 30) and CBL-C384R (43) mutations result in a loss of CBL E3 ligase activity, GM-CSFR Î²c levels were expected to be higher in mutant CBL-expressing cells. Surprisingly, expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R (Fig. 2A, lanes 4â€“9) results in a decrease in GM-CSFR Î²c compared with wild type CBL (lanes 1â€“3)-expressing cells at 0, 10, and 60 min (Fig. 2B). However, it is important to note that GM-CSFR Î²c expression decreased after GM-CSF stimulation in wild type and mutant CBL-expressing cells at comparable rates. These results indicate that although expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R results in an overall decreased expression of GM-CSFR Î²c, the degradation of the receptor poststimulation appears not to be disrupted.  FIGURE 2. FIGURE 2. TF-1 cells expressing CBL mutants have lower expression levels of GM-CSFR Î²c. Lysates were collected as described in the legend to Fig. 1. A, immunoblotting (IB) was performed with GM-CSFR Î²c-specific antibody. Blots were reprobed for ... Elevated Levels of JAK2 Kinase in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing TF-1 Cells Upon binding of GM-CSF to GM-CSFRÎ±, a GM-CSFR Î²c homodimer is recruited (6), bringing the Î²c-associated JAK2 kinase (44, 45) into close proximity, allowing transphosphorylation and subsequent activation of the kinase. Activation of JAK2 is essential for downstream GM-CSF signaling (46, 47). The enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c, along with a decrease in the overall expression of the receptor in CBL mutant-expressing cells may be indicative of elevated kinase activity downstream of GM-CSFR Î²c. Because JAK2 is the main tyrosine kinase downstream of GM-CSFR, the GM-CSF-induced activation of JAK2 was assessed. TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R displayed elevated levels of phosphorylated JAK2 upon GM-CSF stimulation (Fig. 3A, top, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9), compared with the wild type CBL controls (lanes 2 and 3). Reprobing for total JAK2, revealed that the observed enhancement of the phospho-JAK2 signal may be due to an increase in the expression of JAK2 in CBL mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 3, A (middle, lanes 4â€“9) and B).  FIGURE 3. FIGURE 3. Expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants results in elevated JAK2. A, lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing wild type and CBL mutants were probed for phospho-Tyr-1007/1008 JAK2 and reprobed for total JAK2 and tubulin. B, blots were quantified ... Linker and RING finger mutations disrupt the E3 ligase activity of CBL (29, 31, 32). Such loss of E3 ligase activity has been shown to result in a significant decrease in the EPO-induced ubiquitination of JAK2 (23). In order to determine whether the increase in total JAK2 in CBL mutant expressing cell lines was due to compromised ubiquitination and degradation of the kinase, TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were treated with proteasomal (MG-132) and lysosomal (chloroquine) inhibitors prior to stimulation. Inhibition of proteasomal and lysosomal degradation stabilized JAK2 to comparable levels in all three cell lines (Fig. 3C, middle). These results indicate that the expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants affects the degradation of JAK2, leading to elevated levels, which in turn contribute to increased JAK2 phosphorylation and potentially signaling in response to GM-CSF stimulation.  Increased Expression of LYN Kinase in CBL Mutant Cells Although JAK2 is the primary kinase activated downstream of GM-CSF receptor, members of the SRC family kinase are stimulated in response to GM-CSF (48â€“50). Specifically, LYN has been shown to directly associate with GM-CSFR Î²c (51) and to play an important role in mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of GM-CSF in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (49, 52). LYN also associates with GM-CSFRÎ± and is involved in the survival signal required for factor-independent growth of cells expressing the FIÎ” GM-CSFR Î²c mutant (48). Considering that TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R show enhanced survival while exhibiting lower expression of GM-CSFR Î²c, we wanted to determine whether LYN phosphorylation and/or expression was altered in CBL mutant-expressing cells. Lysates collected from GM-CSF-stimulated cells were probed with an antibody specific for pY396-LYN, residing in a phosphorylated motif within the LYN activation loop. Increased LYN phosphorylation was observed in cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (Fig. 4A, top, lanes 4â€“9), compared with those expressing wild type CBL (lanes 1â€“3). Reprobing for total LYN revealed that CBL mutant cells have increased levels of LYN (p56) (Fig. 4, A (middle, lanes 4â€“9) and B). This observed increase in LYN expression leads to elevated LYN phosphorylation, which may contribute to the enhanced survival of CBL mutant TF-1 cells.  FIGURE 4. FIGURE 4. Increased expression of LYN kinase in CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutant TF-1 cells. A, whole cell lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing CBL-WT and CBL mutants were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for Tyr(P)-396-LYN. Blots were reprobed for ... Similar to JAK2, treatment with MG-132 and chloroquine stabilized total LYN levels to comparable levels in wild type and mutant cells, indicating that the increase in LYN levels is probably due to the loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL mutants (Fig. 4C).  Expression of CBL Mutants Results in Constitutive S6 Phosphorylation and Enhanced Factor-free Survival Investigation of signaling effectors further downstream of the GM-CSF receptor revealed enhanced phosphorylation of SHP2 in CBL mutant-expressing cells relative to wild type CBL controls (Fig. 5A). Constitutive phosphorylation of S6 in TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R, compared with wild type CBL-expressing controls (Fig. 5B), was also observed. No significant differences were observed in the phosphorylation of STAT5 or ERK1/2 (Fig. 5C) between wild type CBL- and mutant CBL-expressing TF-1 cells after GM-CSF stimulation.  FIGURE 5. FIGURE 5. Expression of CBL mutants results in constitutive phosphorylation of S6 and enhanced survival of TF-1 cells. A, SHP2 immunoprecipitations (IP) were performed on lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing CBL-WT, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R, which were ... XTT assays were performed to determine whether the expression of the CBL linker and RING finger mutants results in enhanced survival and growth. TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants displayed enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF relative to cells expressing wild type CBL (Fig. 5D). The increase in the survival of the mutant-expressing cells decreases with increasing concentration of GM-CSF. Cell counting assays were also performed to confirm these results (data not shown). To determine whether the increase in survival was due to a decrease in apoptosis, annexin V staining was performed on cytokine-deprived wild type and mutant CBL-expressing cells. There was a decrease in annexin V-positive TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H relative to wild type CBL-expressing controls, whereas the proportion of annexin V-positive CBL-C384R-expressing cells was comparable with wild type CBL controls (Fig. 5E). These results indicate that JMML-associated CBL mutations result in enhanced survival of TF-1 cells at low doses of GM-CSF.  Constitutive and Enhanced Phosphorylation of CBL Mutants Is Dependent on an SRC Family Kinase CBL is phosphorylated downstream of numerous oncogenic protein-tyrosine kinases (BCR/ABL and v-SRC), receptor tyrosine kinases (PDGF-R, FLT-3, and c-KIT), and cytokine receptors (TPO and EPO) (reviewed in Ref. 53). For example, CBL is tyrosine-phosphorylated downstream of the Î²c chain in response to IL-3 (33, 34) and GM-CSF (35, 36).  The carboxyl-terminal region of CBL contains three major tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Tyr-700, Tyr-731, and Tyr-774 (54). Phosphorylation of these tyrosines leads to the recruitment of SRC homology 2 domain-containing effectors. Phosphorylated Tyr-700 of CBL binds the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, VAV (55). Phosphorylated Tyr-731 acts as the binding site for the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (56, 57), and members of the CRK adaptor protein family have been shown to bind both phosphorylated Tyr-700 and Tyr-774 (58â€“60). Downstream pathways mediated by CBL tyrosine phosphorylation sites play an important role in CBL-mediated signaling. Linker region mutations of CBL have been shown to lead to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL in Ba/F3-FLT3 cells (24).  We were interested in determining whether expression of the linker region Y371H and the RING finger C384R mutations would result in altered CBL tyrosine phosphorylation. CBL was immunoprecipitated from wild type and mutant CBL TF-1 lysates, and phosphorylation was assessed by Tyr(P) immunoblotting (Fig. 6). CBL-Y371H (lanes 4â€“6) and CBL-C384R (lanes 7â€“9) were highly phosphorylated compared with CBL wild type controls (lanes 1â€“3). Both CBL mutants showed constitutive phosphorylation in the absence of GM-CSF stimulation (lanes 4 and 7).  FIGURE 6. FIGURE 6. Dasatinib treatment abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R. TF-1 cells expressing WT and mutant CBL were incubated with dasatinib and TG101348 for 2 and 4 h, respectively, prior to GM-CSF stimulation. Cells were lysed, and HA ... Although numerous members of the SRC family kinases, including LYN (61â€“63), are capable of phosphorylating CBL, there is evidence that Janus kinase family members may also target CBL for tyrosine phosphorylation (64). To determine whether inhibition of JAK2 or SRC family kinases could abolish the enhanced and constitutive phosphorylation of CBL, TF-1 cells expressing wild type and mutant CBL were treated with either the JAK2-specific inhibitor TG101348 or the SRC family kinase inhibitor dasatinib prior to stimulation. The constitutive and enhanced phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (lanes 22â€“27) persisted in TG101348-treated samples (Fig. 6), whereas pretreatment with dasatinib abolished the elevated phosphorylation of CBL mutants (lanes 13â€“18) to levels comparable with wild type CBL controls (lanes 10â€“12). These results indicate that downstream of the GM-CSF receptor, CBL is phosphorylated by a SRC family kinase, potentially LYN, and mutations in the linker region or the RING finger domain of CBL lead to not only enhanced but also constitutive phosphorylation of CBL.  TG101348-mediated Inhibition of Enhanced Phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in CBL Mutant-expressing Cells We were interested in determining how the inhibition of JAK2 or SRC family kinases downstream of GM-CSFR would modulate the elevated phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c observed in CBL mutant-expressing cells (Figs. 1B and â€‹and7,7, lanes 1â€“9). TF-1 cells were treated with TG101348 and dasatinib, alone or in combination, prior to stimulation and subsequent GM-CSFR Î²c immunoprecipitation. TG101348 treatment resulted in a significant inhibition of GM-CSF-induced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in both wild type CBL- and CBL mutant-expressing cells, resulting in an equally down-modulated level of the phosphorylated receptor (Fig. 7, lanes 10â€“18). This was expected, because JAK2 is known to be the kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c in response to stimulation (47, 65, 66).  FIGURE 7. FIGURE 7. Inhibition of JAK2 activity via treatment with TG101348 abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î² in CBL mutant-expressing cells. TF-1 cells expressing WT-CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were cytokine-depleted and treated with 2 mm TG101348 ... Interestingly, inhibition of SRC family kinases did not result in the inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation, but it did result in an equivalent level of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in wild type CBL and CBL mutant samples (Fig. 7, lanes 19â€“27). Treatment with both TG101348 and dasatinib inhibited GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation (Fig. 7, lanes 28â€“36) to similar levels observed in samples treated with only TG101348.  Go to: DISCUSSION Hypersensitivity to GM-CSF is one of the defining characteristics of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Until recently, genes mutated in JMML patients (NF1, SHP2, NRAS, and KRAS) were directly involved in the RAS signaling pathway. The Loh and Maciejewski groups (20â€“22) found that 10â€“15% of JMML patients have mutations in CBL and that these mutations are associated with acquired uniparental disomy. The majority of CBL mutations identified clustered in the linker region and RING finger, both of which play an important role in the E3 ligase activity of CBL. The identification of these JMML-associated CBL mutations raised a number of questions about the role of CBL downstream of GM-CSF receptor, whether CBL is involved in RAS signaling downstream of GM-CSFR, and how mutations in CBL can lead to hypersensitivity to GM-CSF. In order to address these questions, we utilized the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line, which is GM-CSF-responsive (38) and has a low endogenous CBL expression. To examine the functional consequences of CBL linker region mutations, we expressed CBL-Y371H linker and CBL-C384R RING finger mutants, because these are two of the most common CBL mutations observed in JMML patients (21, 22).  We found that expression of these CBL mutants in GM-CSF-stimulated TF-1 cells leads to enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c, which occurred concurrently with elevated expression of both JAK2 and LYN. Assessment of downstream signaling revealed enhanced phosphorylation of S6 in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells relative to wild type CBL controls. TF-1 cells expressing CBL mutations showed enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF, and specifically in the case of CBL-Y371H-expressing cells, this is probably due to a decrease in induction of apoptosis. We also observed elevated and constitutive phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants, which was inhibited upon treatment with dasatinib, an SRC family kinase inhibitor. Interestingly, treatment with dasatinib also led to equalization of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation between wild type CBL- and CBL mutant-expressing cells. However, inhibition of JAK2 activity by TG101348 resulted in complete inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in CBL mutant and wild type CBL control cells.  Expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants results in prolonged and elevated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, which supports the observed enhancement in survival (67). Martinez-Moczygemba and Huston (37, 68), using the IL-5 receptor as a model for Î²c subunit-sharing cytokine receptors (IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF), demonstrated that increased Î²c subunit ubiquitination is observed after stimulation. This ubiquitination event leads to the proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic tail of the Î²c subunit, which attenuates downstream signaling (37, 68). They also found that the ubiquitination of the Î²c subunit may be mediated by CBL, because the E3 ligase was co-immunoprecipitated with the Î²c subunit. The loss of E3 ligase activity of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants may prevent GM-CSFR Î²c ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic region of the receptor and culminate in the observed enhancement of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation and elevated levels of JAK2. However, this is unlikely, because we have observed total levels of GM-CSFR Î²c to be lower in CBL mutant cells. Alternatively, increased JAK2 and LYN expression could be correlated with a negative feedback loop that down-regulates GM-CSFR Î²c levels in TF-1 cells. The ubiquitination of Î²c in response to IL-5 stimulation is dependent on JAK2 activity (68, 69). In CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells, the enhanced JAK2 activity can potentially lead to increased ubiquitination of the Î²c by other ubiquitin ligases, resulting in decreased overall expression of the receptor subunit.  JAK2 is also regulated via CBL-mediated ubiquitination (23, 70). The expression of CBL mutants Y371H and C384R may result in decreased ubiquitination of JAK2, culminating in elevated levels of JAK2 as well as enhanced JAK2-mediated phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c. We found that in CBL mutant cells, there was elevated expression of JAK2 kinase, which was abolished upon treatment with proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors.  Similar to JAK2, several members of the SRC family kinases (71), including LYN, have been shown to be ubiquitinated (72) by CBL (73, 74). The enhanced expression of LYN in TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R indicates that, downstream of GM-CSFR, CBL is responsible for LYN ubiquitination. LYN mediates the tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL downstream of Î²1 integrin (61), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (62, 75), and the B-cell antigen receptor (63, 76). We have observed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants, which is abolished upon treatment with the SRC family kinase inhibitor dasatinib. This confirms that LYN is a kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL downstream of the GM-CSFR, and the enhanced phosphorylation of CBL mutants may be a functional consequence of the elevated levels of LYN in CBL mutant-expressing cells.  Phosphorylation of CBL Tyr-731 leads to the activation of the PI3K pathway via recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (54, 56). The Corey group (62, 77) has shown that LYN couples to the PI3K pathway in a CBL-dependent manner, whereby activated LYN binds and phosphorylates CBL, allowing for the recruitment of p85 to the complex. LYN also activates the PI3K pathway downstream of GM-CSFR Î± (48), promoting cell survival. We have shown that expression of CBL JMML mutants defective in E3 ubiquitin ligase activity leads to aberrant regulation of LYN downstream of GM-CSFR, which ultimately leads to constitutive and enhanced phosphorylation of S6, suggesting elevated PI3K pathway activity. Interestingly, basal activation of S6 has been observed in mononuclear cells isolated from JMML patients (78). Furthermore, in the absence of LYN, the antiapoptotic effects of GM-CSF are abolished (49, 52). At low concentrations of GM-CSF, the signaling pathways activated downstream of the receptor lead to cell survival only, whereas stimulation with higher doses results in cell proliferation and cell survival (79). We have shown that expression of CBL mutants results in enhanced survival, especially at low doses, or in the complete absence of GM-CSF in TF-1 cells. These data suggest that CBL linker and RING finger mutants lower the threshold concentration of GM-CSF required to induce cell survival. Together, these results suggest that in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells, the modulation of the PI3-K pathway due to the increase in LYN levels may be contributing to the observed enhancement of survival in the absence of GM-CSF.  The mechanism by which these mutations lead to elevated GM-CSF signaling and enhanced survival depends on the role of CBL as both an E3 ligase and an adaptor protein. CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants compromise the E3 ligase activity of CBL. We have shown that these loss-of-function mutations lead to increased levels of JAK2 and LYN kinases downstream of the GM-CSFR, potentially due to loss of ubiquitination of the kinases or to the inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c ubiquitination and cytoplasmic domain degradation. These events contribute to the elevated levels of GM-CSF signaling observed in CBL mutant-expressing TF-1 cells. Sanada et al. (23) have shown that Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ LSK cells show a mild cytokine hypersensitivity, but transformation of Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ LSK cells with Cbl linker region mutants significantly enhances the cytokine hypersensitivity, indicating a gain-of-function of the mutants that cannot be ascribed to a simple loss of CBL E3 ligase activity. Inhibition of Cbl-b function by mutant Cbl has been proposed as a possible mechanism (80, 81). However, it is possible that functionality of CBL as an adaptor protein may be contributing to the gain of function of the mutants. Our group, as well as others, has shown that expression of CBL linker and RING finger mutants results in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL (24, 81, 82). This increase in CBL phosphorylation culminates in enhanced PI3K and RAS pathway activation. We found that treatment with dasatinib results in loss of CBL phosphorylation. Interestingly, dasatinib treatment equalized GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in wild type- and CBL mutant-expressing TF-1 cells. Therefore, dasatinib treatment may decouple the gain-of-function capacity of CBL mutants from the loss of E3 ligase activity. Considering that treatment with JAK2 inhibitor, TG101348, results in complete inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation, dasatinib may provide a treatment option for the enhanced signaling driven by CBL gain-of-function mutations.  Prior studies have shown that expression of CBL linker region and RING finger mutants inhibits stimulation-induced ubiquitination of the EGF-R (23, 29), FLT3, c-KIT, and JAK2 (downstream of EPO-R) (23). Niemeyer et al. (40) have shown that expression of CBL linker region mutants in Ba/F3-EPO-R cells results in an enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, AKT, and S6. In Ba/F3 cells expressing the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase, expression of CBL-Y371 mutants leads to elevated FLT3 phosphorylation as well as AKT and STAT5 (24). Although these studies are useful to probe how CBL mutations perturb FLT3 signaling in AML, no studies have examined the role of CBL JMML mutations in GM-CSF-dependent signaling pathways to date. Our analysis reveals that expression of CBL-Y371H or CBL-C384R in TF-1 cells generates GM-CSF hypersensitivity that affects proximal steps in receptor activation, including GM-CSFR Î²c, JAK2, and LYN coupling to PI3K activation. Unlike with the Ba/F3 results, we failed to observe effects on ERK1/2 or STAT5 activation. Whether this is a function of the unique receptor systems or distinct cell lines remains to be determined.  In conclusion, these studies have confirmed that CBL plays a negative regulatory role downstream of GM-CSFR. We have shown that the enhancement of GM-CSF signaling observed upon loss of CBL E3 ligase activity is due to increased stability of JAK2 and LYN. These results provide in vitro support for further investigation into the applicability of JAK2 and SRC family kinase inhibitors for use in treatment of myeloid malignancies associated with CBL linker region and RING finger mutations. Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors, but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study, we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability, binding, and activity. We found that recurrent, homozygous, and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2, by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and, to a lesser extent, with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding, whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity, and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL, driver mutations, protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations), the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability, interactions, and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures, their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2, 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity, stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5, 6). Strikingly, proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD), a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain, while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time, since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain, they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9, 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK, CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein, thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study, substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach, which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability, binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely, we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent, homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations), zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations), types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition, all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€� missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures, we obtained 2,102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL), (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S), (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13), CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%, the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40,000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX, respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation, optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27), the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs, described above, were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega, Madison, WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15, A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15, and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp., Madison, WI), incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change, and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins, cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals, Fairlawn, NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO], 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®, Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16,000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). For immunoblotting, 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations, 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer, then resuspended in 2X loading buffer, boiled for 5 m, then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman, Sanford, MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins, the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling), rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase, (clone 3F10; Roche), rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc., South Plainfield, NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc., Long Beach, CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination, in the presence of each CBL mutation, was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes, Î”Î”Gfold, upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35, 36). Namely, the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations, recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1, Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall, the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However, it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger, as we show later, this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single, Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V, G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements, whereas other mutations (S376F, Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example, L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations, especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters, compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01, Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations, therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state, consistent with experiments, we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability, recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B, S1 and Table S2). Importantly, cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next, all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations, Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them, several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example, the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10, 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family, it strongly interacts with the Q92, W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q, R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation, there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€�) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€�) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall, we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B, Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6, 38, 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL, then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele, it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed, human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status, trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples, and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods, Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, in the presence of wild-type CBL, activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type, CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells, predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1), binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R, H398Q, Y371H, K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R, H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand, the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This, in turn, could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover, K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B,C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally, the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V, V430M, P428L, Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this, the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific, we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells, transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this, the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells, the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example, the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas V430M, consistent with experimental data, had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally, the third group constituted mutations (L399V, G375P, P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this, there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly, mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast, the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed, the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5, changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison, several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy, they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52, with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations, (30â€“33, 41) and some of them use structural features (31, 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However, all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5, all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58, Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural, foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand, thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites, which might not be energetically optimal (36, 42). In tumorigenesis, protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level, but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43, 44). However, the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein, here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies, which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation, we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity), while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study, about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity, while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models, we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However, these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed, many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations, but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly, the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene, their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47), where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48, 49). Importantly, all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact, the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state, p-value &amp;lt; 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants, one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However, as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes, this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall, our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity, of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases, of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However, there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1), CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand, as shown in our study and in other studies, cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL, so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies, understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed, targeted therapies. Our approach, which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest, emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;Abstract Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is characterized by hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). SHP2, NF-1, KRAS, and NRAS are mutated in JMML patients, leading to aberrant regulation of RAS signaling. A subset of JMML patients harbor CBL mutations associated with 11q acquired uniparental disomy. Many of these mutations are in the linker region and the RING finger of CBL, leading to a loss of E3 ligase activity. We investigated the mechanism by which CBL-Y371H, a linker region mutant, and CBL-C384R, a RING finger mutant, lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling. Expression of CBL mutants in the TF-1 cell line resulted in enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF. Cells expressing CBL mutations displayed increased phosphorylation of GM-CSF receptor Î²c subunit in response to stimulation, although expression of total GM-CSFR Î²c was lower. This suggested enhanced kinase activity downstream of GM-CSFR. JAK2 and LYN kinase expression is elevated in CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutant cells, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of CBL and S6 in response to GM-CSF stimulation. Incubation with the JAK2 inhibitor, TG101348, abolished the increased phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in cells expressing CBL mutants, whereas treatment with the SRC kinase inhibitor dasatinib resulted in equalization of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation signal between wild type CBL and CBL mutant samples. Dasatinib treatment inhibited the elevated phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants. Our study indicates that CBL linker and RING finger mutants lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling due to elevated kinase expression, which can be blocked using small molecule inhibitors targeting specific downstream pathways.  Keywords: Cytokine, E3 Ubiquitin Ligase, JAK Kinase, Signal Transduction, SRC, CBL, GM-CSF, Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia Go to: Introduction Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine that regulates the differentiation, survival, proliferation, and functional activation of granulocytes and monocytes in the myeloid lineage (1). In order to mediate its functional activity, GM-CSF binds to its receptor, the GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR),2 consisting of GM-CSR Î± and GM-CSFR Î² common (Î²c) subunits. The Î²c subunit of the receptor is shared by the IL-3 and IL-5 receptors. Î²c is the major signaling subunit and is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to cytokine stimulation. Î²c phosphorylation results in the recruitment of various effectors leading to activation of downstream signaling (2â€“4). GM-CSFR Î± is the major binding subunit, which dictates the binding specificity of the receptor complex for GM-CSF (2, 4, 5). The engagement of GM-CSFR by GM-CSF results in the formation of a dodecameric complex of GM-CSFÂ·GM-CSFR Î±Â·GM-CSFR Î²c, which leads to the trans-phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c-associated JAK2 kinases (6). The activated JAK2 kinases phosphorylate GM-CSFR Î²c tyrosine residues, allowing for the recruitment of various effectors and the activation of downstream signaling. GM-CSF stimulation results in the activation of the JAK-STAT, PI3K, and the RAS/MAPK pathways, contributing to GM-CSF-mediated differentiation, proliferation, and survival (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 4).  GM-CSF hypersensitivity is one of the defining characteristics of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). This disease is classified by the World Health Organization as a mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease (7). JMML patients must show persistent monocytosis in the absence of the BCR-ABL oncogene (8). Genetic lesions deregulating the RAS signaling pathway have been identified to lead to JMML pathogenesis. 10â€“15% of JMML patients harbor mutations in neurofibromin protein (NF1) (9, 10), a GTPase-activating protein, which negatively regulates RAS by enhancing the hydrolysis of the active GTP-bound conformation of RAS to the inactive GDP-bound form (11). 35% of JMML patients have mutations in SHP2 (12â€“14), a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that positively regulates the RAS signaling pathway (15, 16). RAS-activating mutations account for another 20â€“25% of JMML-associated mutations (17â€“19). Several groups determined that a proportion of JMML patients have 11q uniparental disomy. CBL mutations were identified upon further analysis of the 11q uniparental disomy samples (20â€“22). The presence of NF1, SHP2, RAS, and CBL mutations are mutually exclusive, raising the question of how CBL mutations can lead to disease development.  CBL mutations have been identified in numerous other myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic, myeloproliferative, and mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease (23â€“28). The majority of these mutations localize to the CBL linker region or the RING finger. CBL is a ubiquitin E3 ligase, which specifies target proteins for ubiquitination. The linker region and RING finger of CBL play very important roles in its E3 ligase functionality. The linker region contains two conserved tyrosine residues, Tyr-368 and Tyr-371, whose phosphorylation activates and positively regulates E3 ligase activity of CBL (29â€“31). The CBL RING finger is responsible for recruiting active E2s carrying an ubiquitin moiety, allowing for the transfer of ubiquitin to the target substrate (29, 32). Therefore, it is not surprising that mutations in the linker region and RING finger of CBL identified in myeloid malignancies result in a loss of E3 ligase activity.  JMML is associated with GM-CSF hypersensitivity; however, there is a lack of evidence that specifically examines the role of CBL downstream of the GM-CSF receptor and how JMML-associated CBL mutations may affect GM-CSF signaling. CBL is known to become phosphorylated downstream of the Î²c in response to stimulation by IL-3 (33, 34) and GM-CSF (35, 36). Furthermore, CBL associates with the Î²c subunit upon IL-5 stimulation (37). However, these studies do not directly address the role of CBL in GM-CSF signaling.  The objective of this study is to investigate how JMML-associated CBL mutations modulate GM-CSF signaling and lead to GM-CSF hypersensitivity. We expressed wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R in the human TF-1 hematopoietic cell line, which expresses the endogenous GM-CSF receptor at physiological levels (38). Upon GM-CSF stimulation, elevated phosphorylation of GM-CSF Î²c was observed, resulting from elevated JAK2 and LYN phosphorylation. Expression of CBL JMML mutants resulted in enhanced S6 phosphorylation and increased cell survival. Treatment with pharmacologic inhibitors delineated which proximal GM-CSF-dependent pathways are dependent on JAK2 and LYN activation. In summary, our data show that CBL JMML mutants result in enhanced GM-CSF signaling via modulation of JAK2 and LYN tyrosine kinases.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Constructs pMSCV-HA-CBL retroviral vectors were used to create JMML-associated CBL mutants. HA-tagged CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R were constructed using QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s protocol.  Retrovirus Production HEK 293T cells were plated onto 10-cm dishes (Sarstedt) and grown to around 75% confluence. The 293T cells were transiently transfected with pSV (Gag and Pol proteins) and pVSV-G (envelope protein) and pMSCV-GFP retroviral vectors expressing HA-wild type CBL, HA-CBL-Y371H, or HA-CBL-C384R using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as directed in the manufacturer&#x27;s protocol. Briefly, 4.5 Î¼g of pSV, 1.5 Î¼g of VSV-G, and 4.5 Î¼g of pMSCV-IRES-GFP-HA-CBL constructs were mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 in serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM H-21 for 20 min at room temperature. 293T cells were washed with serum-free DMEM H-21, and 4 ml of serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM H-21 was added to the cells. DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 mixture was added to the plated cells and incubated for 6 h at 37 Â°C. Transfection medium was removed from the cells, and 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum was added. Transfected 293T supernatant containing VSV-G pseudotyped virus carrying pMSCV-HA-CBL was collected at 48 and 72 h post-transfection.  Cell Lines and Culture TF-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 Î¼g of streptomycin/ml, and 2 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. In order to stably express wild type and mutant CBL, TF-1 cells were infected with VSV-G pseudotyped retrovirus carrying wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R constructs. TF-1 cells were suspended in retroviral supernatant supplemented with 8 ng/ml Polybrene and centrifuged in 50-ml tubes at 12,000 rpm for 75 min. TF-1 cells were resuspended in fresh retroviral Polybrene solution and incubated overnight in 6-well dishes at 37 Â°C. A final round of spinoculation with fresh retroviral supernatant was performed on day 2. TF-1 cells were allowed to expand for 48 h. GFP-positive infected TF-1 cells expressing HA-CBL constructs were purified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).  XTT Assay TF-1 cells were cytokine-depleted overnight, as described below. 2000 cells were transferred to each well of a 96-well plate in a final volume of 100 Î¼l of RPMI, 10% FCS with the indicated concentrations of GM-CSF. Plates were incubated at 37 Â°C for 48 h prior to the addition of 3 Î¼m phenazine methosulfate (Sigma) and 2 mg/ml XTT (Diagnostic Chemicals). The cells were incubated with the XTT/phenazine methosulfate solution for 6 h at 37 Â°C. The absorption of the reduction product at 450 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer plate reader.  Annexin V Flow Cytometric Analysis TF-1 cells were cytokine-depleted and maintained in cytokine-free media for 72 h. Cells were stained with annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s protocol (BD Pharmingen). Stained cells were analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer.  Cytokine Deprivation, Stimulation, and Lysis TF-1 cells were washed three times in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), Hanks&#x27; balanced salts; depleted in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum overnight at 37 Â°C; and then stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. Proteasomal and lysosomal degradation was inhibited by incubation of cells with 30 Î¼m MG132 (Calbiochem/Millipore) and 100 Î¼m chloroquine (Sigma), respectively, for 2 h prior to stimulation. JAK2 and LYN kinase activity was inhibited by treatment with 2 m TG101348 (generously provided by Dr. R. Levine) for 4 h or with 0.1 m dasatinib (gift from Dr. D. Hedley) for 2 h, respectively. TF-1 cells were stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF for the indicated times at 37 Â°C.  The cells were washed once in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), Hanks&#x27; balanced salts containing 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and supplemented with â€œcOmpleteâ€� protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). After 5 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 Ã— g for 5 min at 4 Â°C.  Antibodies The 4G10 phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibody and anti-ERK1/2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology/Millipore. Anti-IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSFR Î²c N-20 (used for immunoblotting) and K-17 (used for immunoprecipitations)), anti-Shp2, and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies specific for phospho-JAK2 (Tyr-1007/1008), JAK2, phospho-SRC family (Tyr-416), phospho-Ser-235/236 S6, and Lynp56 were acquired from Cell Signaling Technologies. An anti-phospho STAT5a/b antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc./Invitrogen. Anti-STAT5 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. The monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA antibody was acquired from Roche Applied Science.  Immunoprecipitations Antibodies along with a 50-Î¼l volume of protein A or protein G-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to 2 mg of lysates for an overnight incubation at 4 Â°C. The beads were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer. The immune complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for Western blotting.  Western Blotting Following the electrophoretic transfer of proteins to PVDF membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), the membranes were blocked at room temperature with 2.5% BSA (w/v) or 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl) with Tween 20 for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated with an optimal concentration of the primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 Â°C. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and incubated with the relevant HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30â€“60 min. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence with autoradiographic film (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For reprobing, membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 0.1 m Î²-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 Â°C; rinsed twice in TBST; and blocked in 2.5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline prior to primary antibody incubation. Western blots were scanned and quantified using ImageJ software. Quantified Western blots are presented as mean Â± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student&#x27;s t test.  Go to: RESULTS Enhanced and Prolonged Phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c in CBL Mutant-expressing Cells GM-CSF hypersensitivity is one of the hallmark features of JMML (39). We utilized the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line to investigate the role of JMML-associated CBL mutations in vitro. TF-1 cells endogenously express the GM-CSF receptor Î± (GM-CSFRÎ±) and the IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF receptor Î² common chain (GM-CSFR Î²c), and are responsive to GM-CSF. HA-tagged wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R mutants were stably expressed in TF-1 cells (Fig. 1A). All exogenous constructs showed high expression of CBL when compared with vector-infected cells (Fig. 1A). This is especially advantageous because studies have shown that expression of wild type CBL can rescue or mask the effects of CBL mutants (23, 40).  FIGURE 1. FIGURE 1. Enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSF receptor Î²c upon expression of CBL mutants. A, lysates from parental TF-1 cells as well as from TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were probed for CBL expression. IB, immunoblot. B ... Binding of GM-CSF to the GM-CSF receptor complex activates JAK2, leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c. In order to investigate the effects of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants on GM-CSF signaling, we examined the phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c after stimulation. TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were cytokine-depleted and stimulated with GM-CSF. GM-CSFR Î²c was immunoprecipitated from lysates and immunoblotted with the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Upon GM-CSF stimulation, cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9) show enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c compared with the wild type CBL controls (lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c was observed in CBL mutant samples.  CBL plays an important role in stimulation-induced endocytosis, trafficking, and degradation of numerous tyrosine kinase (29, 32) and cytokine receptors (41, 42). To determine whether expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants has an effect on the expression of the GM-CSFR Î²c, as well as its GM-CSF induced degradation, lysates collected from GM-CSF-stimulated TF-1 cells were probed for GM-CSFR Î²c. Because it is likely that CBL-Y371H (23, 30) and CBL-C384R (43) mutations result in a loss of CBL E3 ligase activity, GM-CSFR Î²c levels were expected to be higher in mutant CBL-expressing cells. Surprisingly, expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R (Fig. 2A, lanes 4â€“9) results in a decrease in GM-CSFR Î²c compared with wild type CBL (lanes 1â€“3)-expressing cells at 0, 10, and 60 min (Fig. 2B). However, it is important to note that GM-CSFR Î²c expression decreased after GM-CSF stimulation in wild type and mutant CBL-expressing cells at comparable rates. These results indicate that although expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R results in an overall decreased expression of GM-CSFR Î²c, the degradation of the receptor poststimulation appears not to be disrupted.  FIGURE 2. FIGURE 2. TF-1 cells expressing CBL mutants have lower expression levels of GM-CSFR Î²c. Lysates were collected as described in the legend to Fig. 1. A, immunoblotting (IB) was performed with GM-CSFR Î²c-specific antibody. Blots were reprobed for ... Elevated Levels of JAK2 Kinase in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing TF-1 Cells Upon binding of GM-CSF to GM-CSFRÎ±, a GM-CSFR Î²c homodimer is recruited (6), bringing the Î²c-associated JAK2 kinase (44, 45) into close proximity, allowing transphosphorylation and subsequent activation of the kinase. Activation of JAK2 is essential for downstream GM-CSF signaling (46, 47). The enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c, along with a decrease in the overall expression of the receptor in CBL mutant-expressing cells may be indicative of elevated kinase activity downstream of GM-CSFR Î²c. Because JAK2 is the main tyrosine kinase downstream of GM-CSFR, the GM-CSF-induced activation of JAK2 was assessed. TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R displayed elevated levels of phosphorylated JAK2 upon GM-CSF stimulation (Fig. 3A, top, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9), compared with the wild type CBL controls (lanes 2 and 3). Reprobing for total JAK2, revealed that the observed enhancement of the phospho-JAK2 signal may be due to an increase in the expression of JAK2 in CBL mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 3, A (middle, lanes 4â€“9) and B).  FIGURE 3. FIGURE 3. Expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants results in elevated JAK2. A, lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing wild type and CBL mutants were probed for phospho-Tyr-1007/1008 JAK2 and reprobed for total JAK2 and tubulin. B, blots were quantified ... Linker and RING finger mutations disrupt the E3 ligase activity of CBL (29, 31, 32). Such loss of E3 ligase activity has been shown to result in a significant decrease in the EPO-induced ubiquitination of JAK2 (23). In order to determine whether the increase in total JAK2 in CBL mutant expressing cell lines was due to compromised ubiquitination and degradation of the kinase, TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were treated with proteasomal (MG-132) and lysosomal (chloroquine) inhibitors prior to stimulation. Inhibition of proteasomal and lysosomal degradation stabilized JAK2 to comparable levels in all three cell lines (Fig. 3C, middle). These results indicate that the expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants affects the degradation of JAK2, leading to elevated levels, which in turn contribute to increased JAK2 phosphorylation and potentially signaling in response to GM-CSF stimulation.  Increased Expression of LYN Kinase in CBL Mutant Cells Although JAK2 is the primary kinase activated downstream of GM-CSF receptor, members of the SRC family kinase are stimulated in response to GM-CSF (48â€“50). Specifically, LYN has been shown to directly associate with GM-CSFR Î²c (51) and to play an important role in mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of GM-CSF in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (49, 52). LYN also associates with GM-CSFRÎ± and is involved in the survival signal required for factor-independent growth of cells expressing the FIÎ” GM-CSFR Î²c mutant (48). Considering that TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R show enhanced survival while exhibiting lower expression of GM-CSFR Î²c, we wanted to determine whether LYN phosphorylation and/or expression was altered in CBL mutant-expressing cells. Lysates collected from GM-CSF-stimulated cells were probed with an antibody specific for pY396-LYN, residing in a phosphorylated motif within the LYN activation loop. Increased LYN phosphorylation was observed in cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (Fig. 4A, top, lanes 4â€“9), compared with those expressing wild type CBL (lanes 1â€“3). Reprobing for total LYN revealed that CBL mutant cells have increased levels of LYN (p56) (Fig. 4, A (middle, lanes 4â€“9) and B). This observed increase in LYN expression leads to elevated LYN phosphorylation, which may contribute to the enhanced survival of CBL mutant TF-1 cells.  FIGURE 4. FIGURE 4. Increased expression of LYN kinase in CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutant TF-1 cells. A, whole cell lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing CBL-WT and CBL mutants were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for Tyr(P)-396-LYN. Blots were reprobed for ... Similar to JAK2, treatment with MG-132 and chloroquine stabilized total LYN levels to comparable levels in wild type and mutant cells, indicating that the increase in LYN levels is probably due to the loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL mutants (Fig. 4C).  Expression of CBL Mutants Results in Constitutive S6 Phosphorylation and Enhanced Factor-free Survival Investigation of signaling effectors further downstream of the GM-CSF receptor revealed enhanced phosphorylation of SHP2 in CBL mutant-expressing cells relative to wild type CBL controls (Fig. 5A). Constitutive phosphorylation of S6 in TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R, compared with wild type CBL-expressing controls (Fig. 5B), was also observed. No significant differences were observed in the phosphorylation of STAT5 or ERK1/2 (Fig. 5C) between wild type CBL- and mutant CBL-expressing TF-1 cells after GM-CSF stimulation.  FIGURE 5. FIGURE 5. Expression of CBL mutants results in constitutive phosphorylation of S6 and enhanced survival of TF-1 cells. A, SHP2 immunoprecipitations (IP) were performed on lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing CBL-WT, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R, which were ... XTT assays were performed to determine whether the expression of the CBL linker and RING finger mutants results in enhanced survival and growth. TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants displayed enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF relative to cells expressing wild type CBL (Fig. 5D). The increase in the survival of the mutant-expressing cells decreases with increasing concentration of GM-CSF. Cell counting assays were also performed to confirm these results (data not shown). To determine whether the increase in survival was due to a decrease in apoptosis, annexin V staining was performed on cytokine-deprived wild type and mutant CBL-expressing cells. There was a decrease in annexin V-positive TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H relative to wild type CBL-expressing controls, whereas the proportion of annexin V-positive CBL-C384R-expressing cells was comparable with wild type CBL controls (Fig. 5E). These results indicate that JMML-associated CBL mutations result in enhanced survival of TF-1 cells at low doses of GM-CSF.  Constitutive and Enhanced Phosphorylation of CBL Mutants Is Dependent on an SRC Family Kinase CBL is phosphorylated downstream of numerous oncogenic protein-tyrosine kinases (BCR/ABL and v-SRC), receptor tyrosine kinases (PDGF-R, FLT-3, and c-KIT), and cytokine receptors (TPO and EPO) (reviewed in Ref. 53). For example, CBL is tyrosine-phosphorylated downstream of the Î²c chain in response to IL-3 (33, 34) and GM-CSF (35, 36).  The carboxyl-terminal region of CBL contains three major tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Tyr-700, Tyr-731, and Tyr-774 (54). Phosphorylation of these tyrosines leads to the recruitment of SRC homology 2 domain-containing effectors. Phosphorylated Tyr-700 of CBL binds the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, VAV (55). Phosphorylated Tyr-731 acts as the binding site for the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (56, 57), and members of the CRK adaptor protein family have been shown to bind both phosphorylated Tyr-700 and Tyr-774 (58â€“60). Downstream pathways mediated by CBL tyrosine phosphorylation sites play an important role in CBL-mediated signaling. Linker region mutations of CBL have been shown to lead to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL in Ba/F3-FLT3 cells (24).  We were interested in determining whether expression of the linker region Y371H and the RING finger C384R mutations would result in altered CBL tyrosine phosphorylation. CBL was immunoprecipitated from wild type and mutant CBL TF-1 lysates, and phosphorylation was assessed by Tyr(P) immunoblotting (Fig. 6). CBL-Y371H (lanes 4â€“6) and CBL-C384R (lanes 7â€“9) were highly phosphorylated compared with CBL wild type controls (lanes 1â€“3). Both CBL mutants showed constitutive phosphorylation in the absence of GM-CSF stimulation (lanes 4 and 7).  FIGURE 6. FIGURE 6. Dasatinib treatment abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R. TF-1 cells expressing WT and mutant CBL were incubated with dasatinib and TG101348 for 2 and 4 h, respectively, prior to GM-CSF stimulation. Cells were lysed, and HA ... Although numerous members of the SRC family kinases, including LYN (61â€“63), are capable of phosphorylating CBL, there is evidence that Janus kinase family members may also target CBL for tyrosine phosphorylation (64). To determine whether inhibition of JAK2 or SRC family kinases could abolish the enhanced and constitutive phosphorylation of CBL, TF-1 cells expressing wild type and mutant CBL were treated with either the JAK2-specific inhibitor TG101348 or the SRC family kinase inhibitor dasatinib prior to stimulation. The constitutive and enhanced phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (lanes 22â€“27) persisted in TG101348-treated samples (Fig. 6), whereas pretreatment with dasatinib abolished the elevated phosphorylation of CBL mutants (lanes 13â€“18) to levels comparable with wild type CBL controls (lanes 10â€“12). These results indicate that downstream of the GM-CSF receptor, CBL is phosphorylated by a SRC family kinase, potentially LYN, and mutations in the linker region or the RING finger domain of CBL lead to not only enhanced but also constitutive phosphorylation of CBL.  TG101348-mediated Inhibition of Enhanced Phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in CBL Mutant-expressing Cells We were interested in determining how the inhibition of JAK2 or SRC family kinases downstream of GM-CSFR would modulate the elevated phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c observed in CBL mutant-expressing cells (Figs. 1B and â€‹and7,7, lanes 1â€“9). TF-1 cells were treated with TG101348 and dasatinib, alone or in combination, prior to stimulation and subsequent GM-CSFR Î²c immunoprecipitation. TG101348 treatment resulted in a significant inhibition of GM-CSF-induced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in both wild type CBL- and CBL mutant-expressing cells, resulting in an equally down-modulated level of the phosphorylated receptor (Fig. 7, lanes 10â€“18). This was expected, because JAK2 is known to be the kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c in response to stimulation (47, 65, 66).  FIGURE 7. FIGURE 7. Inhibition of JAK2 activity via treatment with TG101348 abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î² in CBL mutant-expressing cells. TF-1 cells expressing WT-CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were cytokine-depleted and treated with 2 mm TG101348 ... Interestingly, inhibition of SRC family kinases did not result in the inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation, but it did result in an equivalent level of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in wild type CBL and CBL mutant samples (Fig. 7, lanes 19â€“27). Treatment with both TG101348 and dasatinib inhibited GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation (Fig. 7, lanes 28â€“36) to similar levels observed in samples treated with only TG101348.  Go to: DISCUSSION Hypersensitivity to GM-CSF is one of the defining characteristics of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Until recently, genes mutated in JMML patients (NF1, SHP2, NRAS, and KRAS) were directly involved in the RAS signaling pathway. The Loh and Maciejewski groups (20â€“22) found that 10â€“15% of JMML patients have mutations in CBL and that these mutations are associated with acquired uniparental disomy. The majority of CBL mutations identified clustered in the linker region and RING finger, both of which play an important role in the E3 ligase activity of CBL. The identification of these JMML-associated CBL mutations raised a number of questions about the role of CBL downstream of GM-CSF receptor, whether CBL is involved in RAS signaling downstream of GM-CSFR, and how mutations in CBL can lead to hypersensitivity to GM-CSF. In order to address these questions, we utilized the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line, which is GM-CSF-responsive (38) and has a low endogenous CBL expression. To examine the functional consequences of CBL linker region mutations, we expressed CBL-Y371H linker and CBL-C384R RING finger mutants, because these are two of the most common CBL mutations observed in JMML patients (21, 22).  We found that expression of these CBL mutants in GM-CSF-stimulated TF-1 cells leads to enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c, which occurred concurrently with elevated expression of both JAK2 and LYN. Assessment of downstream signaling revealed enhanced phosphorylation of S6 in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells relative to wild type CBL controls. TF-1 cells expressing CBL mutations showed enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF, and specifically in the case of CBL-Y371H-expressing cells, this is probably due to a decrease in induction of apoptosis. We also observed elevated and constitutive phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants, which was inhibited upon treatment with dasatinib, an SRC family kinase inhibitor. Interestingly, treatment with dasatinib also led to equalization of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation between wild type CBL- and CBL mutant-expressing cells. However, inhibition of JAK2 activity by TG101348 resulted in complete inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in CBL mutant and wild type CBL control cells.  Expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants results in prolonged and elevated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, which supports the observed enhancement in survival (67). Martinez-Moczygemba and Huston (37, 68), using the IL-5 receptor as a model for Î²c subunit-sharing cytokine receptors (IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF), demonstrated that increased Î²c subunit ubiquitination is observed after stimulation. This ubiquitination event leads to the proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic tail of the Î²c subunit, which attenuates downstream signaling (37, 68). They also found that the ubiquitination of the Î²c subunit may be mediated by CBL, because the E3 ligase was co-immunoprecipitated with the Î²c subunit. The loss of E3 ligase activity of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants may prevent GM-CSFR Î²c ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic region of the receptor and culminate in the observed enhancement of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation and elevated levels of JAK2. However, this is unlikely, because we have observed total levels of GM-CSFR Î²c to be lower in CBL mutant cells. Alternatively, increased JAK2 and LYN expression could be correlated with a negative feedback loop that down-regulates GM-CSFR Î²c levels in TF-1 cells. The ubiquitination of Î²c in response to IL-5 stimulation is dependent on JAK2 activity (68, 69). In CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells, the enhanced JAK2 activity can potentially lead to increased ubiquitination of the Î²c by other ubiquitin ligases, resulting in decreased overall expression of the receptor subunit.  JAK2 is also regulated via CBL-mediated ubiquitination (23, 70). The expression of CBL mutants Y371H and C384R may result in decreased ubiquitination of JAK2, culminating in elevated levels of JAK2 as well as enhanced JAK2-mediated phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c. We found that in CBL mutant cells, there was elevated expression of JAK2 kinase, which was abolished upon treatment with proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors.  Similar to JAK2, several members of the SRC family kinases (71), including LYN, have been shown to be ubiquitinated (72) by CBL (73, 74). The enhanced expression of LYN in TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R indicates that, downstream of GM-CSFR, CBL is responsible for LYN ubiquitination. LYN mediates the tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL downstream of Î²1 integrin (61), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (62, 75), and the B-cell antigen receptor (63, 76). We have observed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants, which is abolished upon treatment with the SRC family kinase inhibitor dasatinib. This confirms that LYN is a kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL downstream of the GM-CSFR, and the enhanced phosphorylation of CBL mutants may be a functional consequence of the elevated levels of LYN in CBL mutant-expressing cells.  Phosphorylation of CBL Tyr-731 leads to the activation of the PI3K pathway via recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (54, 56). The Corey group (62, 77) has shown that LYN couples to the PI3K pathway in a CBL-dependent manner, whereby activated LYN binds and phosphorylates CBL, allowing for the recruitment of p85 to the complex. LYN also activates the PI3K pathway downstream of GM-CSFR Î± (48), promoting cell survival. We have shown that expression of CBL JMML mutants defective in E3 ubiquitin ligase activity leads to aberrant regulation of LYN downstream of GM-CSFR, which ultimately leads to constitutive and enhanced phosphorylation of S6, suggesting elevated PI3K pathway activity. Interestingly, basal activation of S6 has been observed in mononuclear cells isolated from JMML patients (78). Furthermore, in the absence of LYN, the antiapoptotic effects of GM-CSF are abolished (49, 52). At low concentrations of GM-CSF, the signaling pathways activated downstream of the receptor lead to cell survival only, whereas stimulation with higher doses results in cell proliferation and cell survival (79). We have shown that expression of CBL mutants results in enhanced survival, especially at low doses, or in the complete absence of GM-CSF in TF-1 cells. These data suggest that CBL linker and RING finger mutants lower the threshold concentration of GM-CSF required to induce cell survival. Together, these results suggest that in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells, the modulation of the PI3-K pathway due to the increase in LYN levels may be contributing to the observed enhancement of survival in the absence of GM-CSF.  The mechanism by which these mutations lead to elevated GM-CSF signaling and enhanced survival depends on the role of CBL as both an E3 ligase and an adaptor protein. CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants compromise the E3 ligase activity of CBL. We have shown that these loss-of-function mutations lead to increased levels of JAK2 and LYN kinases downstream of the GM-CSFR, potentially due to loss of ubiquitination of the kinases or to the inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c ubiquitination and cytoplasmic domain degradation. These events contribute to the elevated levels of GM-CSF signaling observed in CBL mutant-expressing TF-1 cells. Sanada et al. (23) have shown that Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ LSK cells show a mild cytokine hypersensitivity, but transformation of Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ LSK cells with Cbl linker region mutants significantly enhances the cytokine hypersensitivity, indicating a gain-of-function of the mutants that cannot be ascribed to a simple loss of CBL E3 ligase activity. Inhibition of Cbl-b function by mutant Cbl has been proposed as a possible mechanism (80, 81). However, it is possible that functionality of CBL as an adaptor protein may be contributing to the gain of function of the mutants. Our group, as well as others, has shown that expression of CBL linker and RING finger mutants results in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL (24, 81, 82). This increase in CBL phosphorylation culminates in enhanced PI3K and RAS pathway activation. We found that treatment with dasatinib results in loss of CBL phosphorylation. Interestingly, dasatinib treatment equalized GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in wild type- and CBL mutant-expressing TF-1 cells. Therefore, dasatinib treatment may decouple the gain-of-function capacity of CBL mutants from the loss of E3 ligase activity. Considering that treatment with JAK2 inhibitor, TG101348, results in complete inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation, dasatinib may provide a treatment option for the enhanced signaling driven by CBL gain-of-function mutations.  Prior studies have shown that expression of CBL linker region and RING finger mutants inhibits stimulation-induced ubiquitination of the EGF-R (23, 29), FLT3, c-KIT, and JAK2 (downstream of EPO-R) (23). Niemeyer et al. (40) have shown that expression of CBL linker region mutants in Ba/F3-EPO-R cells results in an enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, AKT, and S6. In Ba/F3 cells expressing the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase, expression of CBL-Y371 mutants leads to elevated FLT3 phosphorylation as well as AKT and STAT5 (24). Although these studies are useful to probe how CBL mutations perturb FLT3 signaling in AML, no studies have examined the role of CBL JMML mutations in GM-CSF-dependent signaling pathways to date. Our analysis reveals that expression of CBL-Y371H or CBL-C384R in TF-1 cells generates GM-CSF hypersensitivity that affects proximal steps in receptor activation, including GM-CSFR Î²c, JAK2, and LYN coupling to PI3K activation. Unlike with the Ba/F3 results, we failed to observe effects on ERK1/2 or STAT5 activation. Whether this is a function of the unique receptor systems or distinct cell lines remains to be determined.  In conclusion, these studies have confirmed that CBL plays a negative regulatory role downstream of GM-CSFR. We have shown that the enhancement of GM-CSF signaling observed upon loss of CBL E3 ligase activity is due to increased stability of JAK2 and LYN. These results provide in vitro support for further investigation into the applicability of JAK2 and SRC family kinase inhibitors for use in treatment of myeloid malignancies associated with CBL linker region and RING finger mutations.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;The AML1/EVI-1 chimeric gene is generated by the t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation and plays a pivotal role in progression of hematopoietic stem cell malignancies such as chronic myelocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. In AML1/EVI-1, an N-terminal half of AML1 including a runt homology domain is fused to the entire zinc-finger EVI-1 protein. AML1 is essential for hematopoietic cell development in fetal liver and its lineage-specific differentiation in adult. In contrast, EVI-1 is barely expressed in normal hematopoietic cells, but it is overexpressed in chronic myelocytic leukemia in blastic crisis and myelodysplastic syndrome-derived leukemia. There are at least four mechanisms identified in AML1/EVI-1 fusion protein that possibly lead into malignant transformation of hematopoietic stem cells. Firstly, AML1/EVI-1 exerts dominant-negative effects over AML1-induced transcriptional activation. Although target genes repressed by AML1/EVI-1 are still not known, binding competition to a specific DNA sequence and histone deacetylase recruitment through a co-repressor CtBP in EVI-1 part are conceivable underlying mechanisms for the dominant-negative effects. Secondly, AML1/EVI-1 interferes with TGFbeta signaling and antagonizes the growth-inhibitory effects of TGFbeta. The first zinc-finger domain of EVI-1 associates with Smad3, a TGFbeta signal transducer, and represses its transcriptional activity by recruiting histone deacetylase through CtBP that interacts with EVI-1. Thirdly, AML1/EVI-1 blocks JNK activity and prevents stress-induced apoptosis. AML1/EVI-1 associates with JNK through the first zinc-finger domain of EVI-1 and disturbs the association between JNK and its substrates. Lastly, AML1/EVI-1 enhances AP-1 activity by activating the c-Fos promoter depending on the second zinc-finger domain of EVI-1, and promotes cell proliferation. All these functions cooperatively contribute to the malignant transformation of the hematopoietic stem cells by AML1/EVI-1.  Keywords: AML1/EVI-1, apoptosis, dominant-negative effects, JNK, TGFbeta, transcription factor Top of page Introduction In more than the past 10 years, most of the recurrent chromosomal abnormalities associated with specific subtypes of human leukemia have been molecularly characterized. These studies advanced our understanding in molecular mechanisms of leukemogenesis and provided deep insights for hematopoietic cell development. In particular, reciprocal translocations involving transcription factor-encoding genes play an important role in leukemogenesis through either inappropriate expression of a transcription factor or pathogenic generation of a chimeric transcription molecule. Hirai and his colleagues at the University of Tokyo have cloned several chimeric genes, including the AML1/EVI-1 gene generated by the t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation (Mitani et al., 1994), and established a number of unique molecular models for leukemogenesis induced by this molecule. In this short review, I will focus on the molecular mechanisms of leukemogenesis by AML1/EVI-1 chimeric protein, which have been clarified in his laboratory. I dedicate this review to late Dr Hisamaru Hirai who had been my reliable supervisor as well as helpful mentor, but regrettably passed away on August 23, 2003.  Top of page Cloning of the AML1/EVI-1 gene We first established SKH1 leukemia cell line from a patient with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) in megakaryoblastic crisis acquiring the t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation in addition to the t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation. The AML1/EVI-1 fusion gene generated by the t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation was cloned from this cell line 10 years ago. The t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation fuses the AML1 gene on 21q22 and the EVI-1 gene on 3q26. The t(3;21) (q26;q22) translocation is occasionally observed in CML in blastic crisis or myelodysplastic (MDS)-derived leukemia. Since it is very rare that de novo acute leukemia carries the t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation, the appearance of this chromosomal abnormality may trigger the transformation of chronic hematopoietic stem cell disorder into acute leukemic phase. Actually, treatment with antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the coding sequence of the AML1/EVI-1 junction markedly inhibits the growth of SKH1 cells that carry both the t(3;21) (q26;q22) and the t(9;22) (q34;q11) translocations, but does not inhibit the growth of K562 cells that carry only the t(9;22) (q34;q11) translocation (Mitani et al., 1995). Thus, the AML1/EVI-1 fusion protein could maintain proliferation capacity of the t(3;21)-carrying clones arising after blastic transformation of CML.  Top of page Structure of AML1/EVI-1 The AML1 (now referred to RUNX1) gene was originally isolated as a gene that is located at the translocation breakpoint of chromosome 21 in the t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation specifically found in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) (M2 according to the Frenchâ€“Americanâ€“British classification) (Miyoshi et al., 1991). AML1 has a runt homology domain (RHD) at the N-terminus that is highly homologous to the product of Drosophila segmentation gene runt and alpha subunit of polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2 (PEBP2 or PAE2) (Daga et al., 1992; Bae et al., 1993; Ogawa et al., 1993b) (Figure 1). The AML1 gene is thought to be ubiquitously expressed in multiple hematopoietic lineages because human leukemia cell lines derived from myeloid, B and T lymphoid cells show normal AML1 transcripts (Miyoshi et al., 1991). AML1 heterodimerizes with non-DNA-binding subunit PEBP2beta to form an active DNA-binding complex and binds to a specific DNA consensus sequence named the PEBP2 site that contains R/TACCRAC through RHD (Ogawa et al., 1993a, 1993b). PEBP2beta enhances the DNA-binding activity of AML1 and protects AML1 from ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation (Huang et al., 2001). The prolineâ€“serineâ€“threonine (PST) domain at the C-terminus is required for transcriptional activation. AML1-mediated transcription depends on direct binding of transcriptional co-activators p300, CBP and P/CAF that have intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (Kitabayashi et al., 1998). AML1 is indispensable for expression of a number of hematopoietic lineage-specific genes, including the myeloperoxidase (MPO), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), T-cell receptor (TCR) and NP-3 genes. Gene knockout experiments show that null mutation in either AML1 (Okuda et al., 1996) or PEBP2beta (Sasaki et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1996a, 1996b) is embryonic lethal at E12.5 due to complete lack of fetal liver hematopoiesis and lethal central nervous hemorrhages, although primitive yolk sac erythropoiesis appears normal. Using conditional gene inactivation strategy, AML1 is shown to play a role in T-cell development (Taniuchi et al., 2002). Thus, AML1 is a key transcription factor for the hematopoietic cell development, proliferation and differentiation.  Figure 1.

Wild-type AML1 possesses RHD at the N-terminus and PST region at the C-terminus. In AML1/EVI-1, N-terminal AML1 sequences are abruptly interrupted at the end of the RHD and followed by almost the entire coding region of EVI-1  Full figure and legend (74K)  The EVI-1 (ecotropic viral integration site) gene was initially identified as a common locus of retrovirus integration in myeloid tumors in AKXD mouse (Morishita et al., 1988). EVI-1 is a transcriptional regulator that possesses two Cys2His2-type zinc-finger domains and acidic domain (Morishita et al., 1990). Expression of EVI-1 is barely detectable in healthy murine or human hematopoietic cells. However, EVI-1 is highly expressed in MDS or AML patients showing 3q26 abnormalities such as inv(3)(q21q26) or t(3;3)(q21;q26) (Morishita et al., 1992). Even in the absence of evident 3q36 abnormalities, elevated expression of EVI-1 is reported in CML in blastic crisis and MDS-derived leukemia (Ogawa et al., 1996a). These findings suggest a critical role for EVI-1 in malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells as a dominant oncogene.  In AML1/EVI-1 chimeric cDNA, an open reading frame of 4185 nucleotides encodes a 1395 amino-acid protein (Mitani et al., 1994). The N-terminal portion of AML1 is abruptly interrupted at the end of RHD, followed by a 5&#x27;non-coding sequence of EVI-1 cDNA that is translated through the entire coding region. Therefore, AML1/EVI-1 fusion protein is a chimeric transcription molecule that consists of RHD of AML1 and two zinc-finger domains of EVI-1. In SKH1 cells, two major transcripts in sizes of 8.2 and 7.0 kb are transcribed from the AML1/EVI-1 chimeric gene, and Western analysis shows that AML1/EVI-1 is a 180 kDa chimeric molecule. AML1/EVI-1 promotes pre-existing stem cell disorder into acute leukemia through multiple mechanisms. I will describe the unique functions of each DNA-binding domain of AML1/EVI-1 fusion molecule in detail below.  Top of page Dominant-negative effects over AML1 AML1 transactivates Tww-tk-Luc reporter that contains PEBP2 sites derived from the TCRbeta promoter (Tanaka et al., 1995). However, AML1/EVI-1 does not have such transactivation ability, presumably because it does not contain the PST domain that is necessary for the reporter transactivation. Notably, AML1/EVI-1 reduces the reporter transactivation by AML1 in a dose-dependent manner. The gel shift assay shows that AML1/EVI-1 binds to the PEBP2 site more tightly than AML1 does. Therefore, AML1/EVI-1 could dominantly interfere with the AML1-induced transactivation by competing for the specific DNA binding. Deletion mutation analysis of AML1/EVI-1 shows that RHD is responsible for the dominant-negative effect. To exert transcription activation, AML1 needs to heterodimerize with PEBP2beta through its RHD. AML1 mainly locates in the nucleus, while PEBP2beta locates in the cytoplasm (Tanaka et al., 1998). Immunofluorescence analysis shows that AML1/EVI-1 locates in the nucleus with or without RHD. AML1/EVI-1 seems to drag PEBP2beta into the nucleus because co-expression of the full-length AML1/EVI-1 relocates PEBP2beta from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This effect is RHD-dependent because AML1/EVI-1 lacking RHD does not have such effect, which is consistent with the fact that AML1 associates with PEBP2beta through RHD. Since PEBP2beta more effectively associates with AML1/EVI-1 than AML1, PEBP2beta more efficiently translocates into the nucleus by AML1/EVI-1 than by AML1. This differential effect between AML1/EVI-1 and AML1 presumably causes the dominant-negative effect of AML1/EVI-1 over AML1 and accounts for one of the mechanisms through which this chimeric protein contributes to leukemogenesis.  Recently, we found that AML1/EVI-1 interacts with C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), which is essential for repressing the AML1-induced transactivation (Izutsu et al., 2002) (Figure 2). CtBP was originally identified as a protein that interacts with a C-terminal portion of adenovirus E1A protein. To date, two highly related proteins, termed CtBP1 and CtBP2, have been identified in both mice and humans. CtBP belongs to a member of co-repressor proteins that mediates repression by associating with several transcription factors, including KrÃ¼ppel-like factor (BKLF), friend of GATA (FOG) and T-cell factor (TCF). Although it is not clear how CtBP mediates transcriptional repression, it is supposed that histone deacetylase (HDAC)-1 that interacts with CtBP is involved in the process. We previously determined that EVI-1 interacts with CtBP exclusively through one of the two potential CtBP-binding amino-acid sequences (N-terminal PFDLT and C-terminal PLDLS) that locate next to the second zinc-finger domain (Izutsu et al., 2001). These two sequences are conserved in AML1/EVI-1 and one of them mediates interaction with CtBP. AML1/EVI-1 interferes with the AML1-induced transactivation, while AML1/EVI-1 with mutations in PLDLS does not. Therefore, AML1/EVI-1 requires CtBP as a co-repressor to dominantly inhibit the AML1-induced transactivation. An HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A relieves this dominant-negative effect of AML1/EVI-1. Therefore, it is conceivable that AML1/EVI-1 positively prevents the AML1-induced transcription by recruiting HDAC through CtBP.  Figure 2. Figure 2 - Unfortunately we are unable to provide accessible alternative text for this. If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author AML1/EVI-1 exerts dominant-negative effects over wild-type- AML1. AML1 becomes an active transcription factor by heterodimerizing with PEBP2beta through RHD. PEBP2beta increases the DNA-binding ability of AML1 and protects AML1 from the ubiquitin system-mediated degradation. As AML1/EVI-1 binds to PEBP2beta more tightly than AML1, AML1/EVI-1 competes AML1 out from the PEBP2 sites. Moreover, AML1/EVI-1 associates with a co-repressor CtBP and thereby recruits HDAC. AML1/EVI-1 actively represses the transcription of potential AML1 target genes. CtBP, C-terminal binding protein; HDAC, histone deacetylase; PEBP2, polyomavirus enhancer binding protein 2  Full figure and legend (124K)  AML1/EVI-1 blocks granulocytic differentiation of a murine myeloid cell line 32Dcl3 induced by G-CSF (Tanaka et al., 1995). Parental 32Dcl3 cells acquire mature granulocytic phenotype characterized by cytoplasmic granules and segmented/circular nucleus when cultured with G-CSF for several days. A robust induction of MPO mRNA is also observed by Northern analysis. 32Dcl3 cells overexpressing AML1/EVI-1 maintain immature morphological phenotypes characterized by a large unsegmented nucleus even in the presence of G-CSF (Izutsu et al., 2002). In parallel, there is poor induction of MPO mRNA in these cells. Thus, overexpression of AML1/EVI-1 blocks G-CSF-induced differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells into mature granulocytic phenotype. On the contrary, in 32Dcl3 cells overexpressing mutant AML1/EVI-1 that is unable to interact with CtBP, the morphological changes and induction of MPO mRNA are indistinguishable from those of parental 32Dcl3 cells. These results suggest that AML1/EVI-1 blocks G-CSF-induced granulocytic maturation by interacting with CtBP. Taken together, CtBP-mediated repression of gene transcription could be one of the mechanisms for AML1/EVI-1-mediated block in granulocyte differentiation.  Top of page Repression of transforming growth factor bold italic beta (TGFbold italic beta)-mediated growth inhibition Cell growth and differentiation are tightly regulated by delicate balance of growth factors and growth-inhibitory factors. TGFbeta inhibits proliferation of a wide range of cell types including epithelial, endothelial and hematopoietic cells. Binding of TGFbeta to the heteromeric serine/threonine kinase receptor complex leads to direct phosphorylation of intracellular signal transducers Smad2 and Smad3, followed by the formation of heteromeric complexes with a common signal transducer Smad4, and subsequent their translocation into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, Smad complexes are thought to act as a transcriptional activator to inhibit cellular proliferation. We demonstrated that EVI-1 perturbs TGFbeta signaling and inhibits proliferation of a wide variety of cells. EVI-1 represses transcriptional activation of TGFbeta-responsive reporters such as the plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) or p15 promoter-Luciferase construct (Kurokawa et al., 1998a). There is no effect of EVI-1 on the basal activity of these promoters, indicating that this inhibitory effect works specifically toward TGFbeta-induced transcriptional activation. In growth inhibition experiment, EVI-1 antagonizes the anti-proliferative effects of TGFbeta against TGFbeta-sensitive Mv1Lu cells. Biochemically, most of retinoblastoma (Rb) proteins in the EVI-1-expressing cells remain in the hyperphosphorylated forms even in the presence of TGFbeta, whereas the control cells treated with TGFbeta accumulate hypophosphorylated Rb and show a decreased level of Rb protein. The first zinc-finger domain of EVI-1 mediates interaction with Smad3, and the small region next to the second zinc-finger domain (repression domain) is required to repress TGFbeta signaling. The association between EVI-1 and CtBP is essential for the inhibition of PAI-1 reporter construct. Trichostatin A treatment alleviates EVI-1-mediated repression of TGFbeta-responsive reporters, suggesting that HDAC is involved in this repression. Consistent with this, Mv1Lu cells overexpressing EVI-1 with a mutated PLDLS show normal growth inhibition as parental Mv1Lu cells when treated with TGFbeta.  Similar to EVI-1, AML1/EVI-1 inhibits transactivation of TGFbeta-responsive promoters (Kurokawa et al., 1998b). The constitutive expression of AML1/EVI-1 or EVI-1 in 32Dcl3 cells overcomes TGFbeta-mediated inhibition of cell growth. From these data, AML1/EVI-1 and EVI-1 can potentially block growth inhibition of hematopoietic cells mediated by TGFbeta. MOLM-1 is a human megakaryoblastoid cell line carrying the inv(3)(q21q26) and endogenously expressing a truncated form of EVI-1 proteins in which the C-terminal amino acids of wild-type EVI-1 are replaced by five amino acids (Ogawa et al., 1996b). EVI-1 in MOLM-1 cells retain both the first zinc-finger and the repression domains that are required for repression of TGFbeta signaling. Thus, MOLM-1 cells do not respond to TGFbeta-mediated growth inhibition. However, it becomes TGFbeta sensitive when treated with antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the sequence encoding the N-terminus of the first zinc-finger domain of EVI-1. Just like wild-type-EVI-1, AML1/EVI-1 physically interacts with Smad3 and inhibits the Smad3 activity (Figure 3). AML1/EVI-1 also associates with CtBP through the CtBP-binding consensus sequence PLDLS. As endogenous CtBP proteins are detected in SKH1 cells, it could be possible that TGFbeta signaling is repressed in this leukemia cell line. While the interaction of CtBP and HDAC1 is clearly demonstrated, association between AML1/EVI-1 and HADC1 is not yet determined. However, it is speculated that AML1/EVI-1 recruits HDACs through CtBP to repress TGFbeta-responsive transcription. Thus, in leukemia with the t(3;21) translocation, AML1/EVI-1 may contribute to leukemogenesis by blocking the growth-inhibitory effect of TGFbeta.  Figure 3.

(a) Upon TGFbeta binding to the heteromeric serine/threonine kinase receptor complex, type II receptor activates type I receptor and thereby phosphorylates Smad3. Phosphorylated Smad3 forms a complex with Smad4 and translocates into the nucleus, where they work as a transcription factor to inhibit cellular growth. (b) AML1/EVI-1 binds to Smad3 through the first zinc-finger domain in EVI-1 and actively interferes with Smad3 transcriptional activity.

In vertebrates, at least three pathways have been identified: ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. Generally, ERK signaling is involved in controlling cell proliferation and differentiation, while JNK or p38 signaling plays an important role in triggering apoptosis in response to cellular stresses such as UV light, italic gamma-radiation, osmotic shock, protein synthesis inhibitors, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-1. EVI-1 acts as an inhibitor of JNK, either when overexpressed JNK is unstimulated or stimulated by UV light, anisomycin, sorbitol and TNFalpha (Kurokawa et al., 2000). However, EVI-1 does not affect the kinase activities of overexpressed ERK and p38. Furthermore, Rat1 cells overexpressing EVI-1 show downregulated endogenous JNK activity. In MOLM-1 cells, the endogenous JNK activity is reduced. However, when treated with EVI-1 antisense oligonucleotide, the JNK activity is restored. The same results are obtained in the experiment using human endometrial carcinoma cell line HEC1B that expresses EVI-1 at a high level. Consistently, the presence of EVI-1 actually reduces phosphorylated substrates of c-Jun. JNK activation requires phosphorylation on two specific amino-acid residues Thr183 and Tyr185 by MMK4 or MMK7. Although EVI-1 physically interacts with JNK, it does not affect its phosphorylation status. However, the binding between JNK and c-Jun is significantly reduced by concomitant expression of EVI-1. This suggests that EVI-1 inhibits c-Jun phosphorylation by inhibiting the association between JNK and c-Jun (Figure 4). EVI-1 associates JNK through the first zinc-finger domain. This interaction is essential for inhibition of JNK activity. EVI-1 constitutively associates with JNK in HEC1B cells, and this interaction is increased by the treatment with UV light.  Figure 4. Figure 4 - Unfortunately we are unable to provide accessible alternative text for this. If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author EVI-1 inhibits JNK activity. (a) Various kinds of stresses such as UV light, italic gamma-radiation, osmotic shock, heat shock and protein synthesis inhibitor activate JNK by phosphorylation. Activated JNK translocates into the nucleus, phosphorylates transcription factors such as Jun and triggers apoptosis induction. (b) EVI-1 blocks association between JNK and its substrates and thereby represses JNK activity to induce apoptosis. JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase  Full figure and legend (131K)  We also demonstrated that EVI-1 inhibits apoptotic cell death by interfering with JNK signaling pathway. 293 cells undergo apoptosis via JNK signaling induced by UV light. Overexpression of EVI-1 in 293 cells significantly represses apoptosis induction by UV light. On the other hand, HEC1B cells are resistant to apoptosis, presumably because they express endogenous EVI-1. However, HEC1B cells treated with EVI-1-specific antisense oligonucleotide easily undergo apoptosis. Stress activation of JNK promotes upregulation of FasL expression in T lymphocytes, which is one of the mechanisms potentially causing apoptosis. FasL expression induced by UV stimulation in Jurkat cells is prevented by EVI-1 depending on the first zinc-finger domain. EVI-1 actually blocks apoptosis induction by UV light, and represses activation of FasL reporter stimulated by UV light and anisomycin in Jurkat cells. Furthermore, EVI-1 inhibits apoptosis induction by TNFalpha in U937 cells by repressing JNK activity. In conclusion, EVI-1 blocks both the molecular and biological activities of JNK.  It has not been determined whether AML1/EVI-1 possesses the similar anti-apoptotic effect as EVI-1 does. However, because this function is dependent on the first zinc-finger domain in EVI-1, it is reasonable to speculate that AML1/EVI-1 also prevents apoptosis induction by inhibiting JNK.  Top of page Stimulation of proliferation AP-1 (Fos/Jun heterodimer or Jun/Jun homodimer) is activated by growth stimuli, including growth factors, phorbol esters such as 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate (TPA) and various oncogene products, and stimulates transactivation through TPA responsive site (TRE). AP-1 functions as a positive or negative regulator in a variety of cellular differentiation and proliferation processes. EVI-1 raises AP-1 activity in NIH3T3 cells and embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell line P19 (Tanaka et al., 1994). EVI-1-transfected P19 cells show differentiated phenotypes, characterized by flattened and enlarged morphology. These changes are indistinguishable from the morphological changes seen in P19 cells treated with retinoic acid or transfected with c-Jun. The stage-specific embryonic antigen SSEA-1, known as a stem cell marker in EC cells, is detected in parental P19 cells, but not in EVI-1-transfected P19 cells. In contrast to SSEA-1, the heat shock protein Hsp47, known as a differentiation marker, is detected in EVI-1-transfected P19 cells, but not in parental cells. In addition, expression of c-Jun and c-Fos is increased in EVI-1-tansfected cells. EVI-1 enhances the activity of the c-Fos promoter in NIH3T3 and P19 cells, depending on the second zinc-finger domain (Figure 5). It is shown that the second zinc-finger domain is essential for both the activation of AP-1 and transactivation of the c-Fos promoter.  Figure 5.

If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author EVI-1 stimulates AP-1 activity. EVI-1 activates c-Fos transcription. Fos associates with Jun to form a heterodimer and stimulates TRE-mediated transcription. Increased AP-1 activity by EVI-1 promotes cellular proliferation.

Rat1 cells expressing AML1/EVI-1 form macroscopic colonies in soft agar, while the mock-transfected cells produce tiny, barely macroscopic ones. This indicates that AML1/EVI-1 is a transforming gene. Introduction of AML1/EVI-1 into the Rat1 clones harboring BCR/ABL confers enhanced capacity for anchorage-independent growth. AML1/EVI-1 also stimulates AP-1 activity. As the second zinc-finger domain is required for both transformation of Rat1 cells and an increase in AP-1 activity, it is conceivable that AML1/EVI-1 transforms Rat1 cells by AP-1 activation. Notably, AML1/EVI-1-transformed colonies express c-Jun mRNA. Since AML1/EVI-1 exaggerates the transforming activity of BCR/ABL, AML1/EVI-1 could perform a critical role in leukemic progression of CML.  Top of page Conclusion Similar to other AML1-related chimeras, AML1/EVI-1 exerts dominant-negative effects over AML1-induced transcription. However, target genes that may have a key role in leukemogenesis are still not elucidated. On the other hand, almost the entire coding region of EVI-1 is expressed under the AML1 promoter in leukemic cells carrying AML1/EVI-1 chimeric gene. Since ectopic expression of EVI-1 is thought to be involved in leukemic transformation of CML and MDS, EVI-1 portion in AML1/EVI-1 fusion molecule may also play a critical role in leukemogenesis. Notably, AML1/EVI-1 and EVI-1 share similar functions; the first zinc-finger and the repression domains exhibit anti-growth repression effect by blocking TGFbeta signaling, the first zinc-finger domain exhibits anti-apoptotic effect by repressing JNK signaling, and the second zinc-finger domain exhibits proliferation stimulation effect by increasing AP-1 activity. All these effects are related to leukemic cell proliferation, directly or indirectly. The molecular mechanisms of leukemogenesis by AML1/EVI-1 are summarized in Figure 6. The multi-functions of AML1/EVI-1 fusion molecule are mostly demonstrated by in vitro experiments. Our next step is to generate AML1/EVI-1 leukemia model mice and demonstrate these functions in vivo. It is plausible that AML1/EVI-1 knock-in mice are embryonic lethal in the mid-gestation because of the dominant-negative effects of AML1/EVI-1 over normal AML1, as is the case with AML1/ETO knock-in mice. Thus, we are planning to make conditional AML1/EVI-1 knock-in mice to enable temporal and special expression control of the chimeric molecule.   Abstract  RUNX1-EVI1 is a chimeric gene generated by t(3;21)(q26;q22) observed in patients with aggressive transformation of myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelogenous leukemia. RUNX1-EVI1 has oncogenic potentials through dominant-negative effect over wild-type RUNX1, inhibition of Jun kinase (JNK) pathway, stimulation of cell growth via AP-1, suppression of TGF-Î²-mediated growth inhibition and repression of C/EBPÎ±. Runx1-EVI1 heterozygous knock-in mice die in uteri due to central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage and severe defects in definitive hematopoiesis as Runx1â€“/â€“ mice do, indicating that RUNX1-EVI1 dominantly suppresses functions of wild-type RUNX1 in vivo. Acute myelogenous leukemia is induced in mice transplanted with bone marrow cells expressing RUNX1-EVI1, and a Runx1-EVI1 knock-in chimera mouse developed acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. These results suggest that RUNX1-EVI1 plays indispensable roles in leukemogenesis of t(3;21)-positive leukemia. Major leukemogenic effect of RUNX1-EVI1 is mainly through histone deacetyltransferase recruitment via C-terminal binding protein. Histone deacetyltransferase could be a target in molecular therapy of RUNX1-EVI1-expressing leukemia. (Cancer Sci 2008; 99: 1878â€“1883) The t(3;21)(q26;q22) chromosomal translocation occurs in patients with aggressive transformation of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The presence of this chromosomal translocation indicates poor prognosis.(1â€“3) In the chromosomal joining region of t(3;21)(q26;q22), the RUNX1 gene on 21q22 is fused with the EVI1 (ecotropic viral integration site-1) gene on 3q26.5. Previously, we cloned the RUNX1-EVI1 fusion gene from a case with blastic crisis of CML developing additional to the t(3;21) translocation.(4) This chimeric transcription factor is believed to be a molecular culprit for the leukemic progression of stem cell malignancies caused by t(3;21)(q26;q22). Molecular and biological function of wild-type RUNX1  The RUNX1 protein mainly consists of two functional domains; the Runt homology domain (which is known as a DNA-binding domain), and the proline-, serine- and threonine-rich (PST) region (which is known as a putative transcriptional activation domain) (Fig. 1). RUNX1 forms a heterodimeric active transcriptional complex with the non-DNA-binding Î² subunit (CBFÎ²/PEBP2Î²) and binds to a specific DNA consensus sequence (ACCRCA) named PEBP2.(5â€“9) Runx1- or CbfÎ²-deficient mice are embryonic lethal at day 12.5 of gestation (E12.5), showing massive hemorrhage in the central nervous system (CNS) and lack of hematopoiesis in the fetal liver.(10â€“14) A recent study demonstrated that inactivation of Runx1 in adult mice results in megakaryocyte maturation arrest, block in T- and B-lymphocyte development and increase in hematopoietic precursor cells.(15) A subsequent study by the same group showed that the number of quiescent hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) is also negatively regulated by RUNX1.(16) Clinically, mutations in RUNX1 have been identified in 15% to 40% of MDS-refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) and MDS/acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).(17,18) Patients with MDS/AML with the RUNX1 mutations have a significantly worse prognosis than those without them.

Wild-type RUNX1 has Runt homology domain at the N-terminus and proline-, serine- and threonine-rich (PST) region at the C-terminus. In RUNX1-EVI1, RUNX1 protein is truncated at the end of the Runt homology domain and followed by almost the entire coding region of EVI1 molecule including the PRDI-BF1-RIZ1 (PR) domain. Molecular and biological function of wild-type EVI1  The Evi1 gene was initially identified as a frequent retrovirus integration site in myeloid tumors in AKXD mice.(19) EVI1 expression is low in normal hematopoietic cells, but it is highly expressed in some patients of MDS or AML.(20,21) EVI1 has four major functional domains; the two zinc finger (ZF) domains, the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP)-binding site, and the acidic domain (AD) (Fig. 1). The CtBP-binding site is located between the two ZF domains, and the AD is located in the most C-terminus. EVI1 is reported to interfere with transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²) signaling, and antagonize its growth inhibitory effect through targeting an intracellular signal transducer Smad3.(22) EVI1 is also known to enhance AP-1 activity(23) and to block c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity,(24) as described below. Evi1â€“/â€“ mice die at E10.5, and HSC in Evi1â€“/â€“ embryos are markedly decreased in numbers, with defective self-renewing proliferation and repopulating capacity.(25) The study also shows that Evi1 directly regulates the transcription of Gata-2, which controls both the maintenance and proliferation of HSC. It was also recently reported that the decreased colony forming capacity of Evi1â€“/â€“ para-aortic splanchnopleural (P-Sp) cells could be rescued by retroviral Gata-2 expression, and by blocking of TGFÎ² signaling using an in vitro cultivation system of murine P-Sp regions.(26)  The MDS1 gene was originally identified as a distinct gene from the EVI1 gene, and the putative intergenic splicing form between MDS1 and EVI1 found in normal and leukemic cells was designated as MDS1/EVI1.(27) Because the breakpoint in the chromosome 3 of t(3;21)(q26;q22) is located in the 5â€² region of the MDS1 gene, and the resultant RUNX1-EVI1 fusion gene includes the first and second exons of the MDS1 gene between RUNX1 and EVI1 sequences, RUNX1-EVI1 is also called as RUNX1-MDS1/EVI1. However, at present, MDS1 is recognized as one of the alternative spliced form of the EVI1 gene.(28) In MDS1/EVI1, a 188 amino-acid region called the PR domain, which consists of the first and second exons of MDS1 and the second and third exons of EVI1, is fused to the N-terminal of the EVI1 molecule. The PR domain was originally identified in human retinoblastoma protein-binding protein RIZ1(29) and the human transcriptional repressor PRDI-BF1,(30) and has been found in at least 17 kinds of diverse proteins to date. A large body of evidence suggests that PR domain family (PRDM) proteins are involved in regulation of cellular growth as well as tumorigenesis.(28) It is interesting that the PR domains are generally located in the N-terminal region of proteins, and that alternative splicing creates two forms of the PR domain proteins; a long form that has the PR domain (PR+) and a short form that lacks the PR domain (PRâ€“). Decreased expression of PR+ molecules and/or overexpression of PRâ€“ molecules are observed in a variety of cancer cells, suggesting a functional antagonism, in which the PR+ forms contribute to tumor suppression while the PRâ€“ forms are oncogenic.  For the EVI1 gene, EVI1 (PR-) is highly expressed in cases with human AML or MDS as a consequence of chromosomal rearrangements involving 3q26. Increased expression of EVI1 (PR-) is also observed without 3q26 abnormalities. Recent studies have shown that increased expression of EVI1 (PR-) in AML, which occurs in approximately 10% of the cases, is associated with unfavorable outcomes.(20,21) Molecular structure and function of RUNX1-EVI1  Molecular structure of RUNX1-EVI1.â€‚ The RUNX1-EVI1 fusion gene is translated in frame to generate a chimeric transcription factor in which RUNX1-EVI1 chimeric complementary DNA (cDNA), an open reading frame of 4185 nucleotides, encodes a 1395 amino-acid protein. The N-terminal of RUNX1 molecule including its Runt DNA-binding domain is fused to almost the entire portion of EVI1 molecule (Fig. 1). Therefore, the RUNX1-EVI1 fusion protein is a chimeric transcription molecule that consists of the Runt domain of RUNX1 and two ZF domains, CtBP-binding site and AD of EVI1. Dominant-negative function over wild-type RUNX1.â€‚ RUNX1-EVI1 dominantly suppresses the transactivation capacity of RUNX1 through the PEBP2 sites (Fig. 2).(5â€“9) Competition for the PEBP2 site-binding is proposed to be a mechanism of such dominant negative effects, since RUNX1-EVI1 binds to the PEBP2 sites with higher affinity than RUNX1 does. On binding to the PEBP2 site, RUNX1-EVI1 is believed to recruit corepressor complex via CtBP, since it is reported that RUNX1-EVI1 requires interaction with CtBP to repress RUNX1-induced transactivation.(31) In addition, the association with CtBP is also required for RUNX1-EVI1 to block myeloid differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), indicating that the association with CtBP is critical for RUNX1-EVI1 to exert its biological functions in vivo. Taken together, it is suggested that one of the mechanisms for RUNX1-EVI1-meidated leukemogenesis is the dominant-negative effects over wild-type RUNX1 through an aberrant recruitment of a transcriptional corepressor complex.  Figure 2.  Figure 2. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide (a) RUNX1-EVI1 exerts dominant-negative effects over wild-type RUNX1. RUNX1 forms an active transcription factor by heterodimerizing with CBFÎ² through Runt homology domain. CBFÎ² increases the DNA-binding ability of RUNX1 and protects RUNX1 from degradation. (b) Because RUNX1-EVI1 binds CBFÎ² more strongly than RUNX1, RUNX1-EVI1 competes RUNX1 out from the PEBP2 sites. RUNX1-EVI1 associates with CtBP and recruits HDAC. RUNX1-EVI1 actively represses the transcription of the RUNX1 target genes. Stimulation of cell growth through AP-1.â€‚ The transcription factor AP-1 (Fos/Jun heterodimer or Jun/Jun homodimer) represents a prototype of regulatory protein that converts extracellular signals into gene expressions. AP-1 is activated by growth stimuli, including growth factors, phorbol esters such as 12-0-tetradec-anoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), and various transforming oncogene products. In addition, AP-1 functions as a positive or negative regulator in a variety of cellular differentiation processes, such as changes in the differentiation processes of embryonal carcinoma cell lines, preadipocytes and myoblasts. Previously, we showed that Rat1 cells expressing RUNX1-EVI1 chimeric protein formed macroscopic colonies in soft agar,(32) indicating that RUNX1-EVI1 has oncogenic potential. Removal of the second ZF domain within the EVI1 sequence totally abrogated the ability of RUNX1-EVI1 to transform Rat1 cells. We showed that the transforming effect is correlated with the AP-1 activation induced by RUNX1-EVI1.(33) Inhibition of JNK pathway.â€‚ JNK is activated preferentially by extracellular stress stimuli including UV light, Î³-radiation, osmotic shock, protein synthesis inhibitors, tumor necrosis factor-Î± and interleukin-1.(34) The JNK pathway is thought to play an important role in triggering apoptosis in response to cellular stresses. The activated JNKs translocate into the nucleus where they phosphorylate transcription factors such as c-Jun, and strongly augment their transcriptional activity. We showed that EVI1 physically interacts with and thereby inhibits the function of JNK.(24) For instance, EVI1 inhibits stress-induced cell death by inhibiting JNK. This inhibition of cell death by Evi1 could contribute to oncogenic transformation of cells. It has not been determined whether RUNX1-EVI1 possesses the similar antiapoptotic effect as EVI1 does. However, given that this antiapoptotic function is dependent on the first ZF domain in EVI1, it is reasonable to speculate that RUNX1-EVI1 also inhibits cell apoptosis by inhibiting JNK. Suppression of TGF-Î² -mediated growth inhibition.â€‚ TGF-Î² is one of the best characterized members of growth inhibitory factors. TGF-Î² inhibits proliferation of a wide range of cell types including epithelial, endothelial and hematopoietic cells.(35,36) Intracellular mechanisms that transmit TGF-Î² signaling have been clarified in detail. When TGF-Î² binds to its receptors, the down-stream signaling molecules Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated by the activated TGF-Î² receptors, followed by oligomerization with Smad4. The Smad2/4 or Smad3/4 complexes accumulate in the nucleus, interact with DNA, and activate the transcription of TGF-Î²-responsive genes.(37,38) This process is apparently simple, but many proteins, including inhibitory Smads, participate in regulating the process and modify cellular responses to the stimuli. Previously we reported that EVI1 antagonizes the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-Î² in the epithelial cells.(22) Consistent with this finding, RUNX1-EVI1 also represses TGF-Î²-mediated growth inhibition of a murine hematopoietic precursor cell line, 32Dcl3.(39) The ability of RUNX1-EVI1 to repress TGF-Î² signaling depends on the two separate regions of the EVI1 portion, one of which is the first ZF domain. RUNX1-EVI1 interacts with Smad3 through this domain, and represses the Smad3 activity as EVI1 does.  Recently we have demonstrated that EVI1 represses Smad-induced transcription by recruiting CtBP as a corepressor,(40) indicating that RUNX1-EVI1 represses Smad3 activity through recruitment of CtBP.(31) EVI1 and RUNX1-EVI1 associate with CtBP through one of the consensus binding motifs, and this association is required for efficient inhibition of TGF-Î² signaling. A specific inhibitor for histone deacetylase (HDAC) alleviates EVI1-mediated repression of TGF-Î² signaling, suggesting that HDAC is involved in transcriptional repression by EVI1. The association with CtBP is required for RUNX1-EVI1 to block myeloid differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells induced by G-CSF.  Several chimeric proteins, such as RUNX1-ETO,(41,42) PML-RARÎ±(43) and BCR-ABL(44) have self-interaction domains that are critical for their oncogenic capacity. RUNX1-EVI1 was reported to homo-oligomerize through at least three oligomerization regions,(45) i.e. the Runt domain, the first and the second ZF domains. Deletion of the second ZF domain significantly reduces the differentiation block of primary murine bone marrow progenitors by RUNX1-EVI1. A point mutation that inhibits CtBP binding also completely abrogates the effects of RUNX1-EVI1 on differentiation. These results imply the importance of homo-oligomerization for RUNX1-EVI1 chimeric proteins to exert its leukemogenic potentials. Repression of C/EBPÎ±.â€‚ C/EBPÎ± (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein Î±) is a leucine zipper transcription factor that regulates the expression of target genes containing C/EBP sites in their promoter regions.(46,47) Of the genes related to hematopoiesis, these genes include CEBPA itself,(48) CEBPE(48,49) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor.(48,50) Inducible expression of C/EBPÎ± is sufficient to trigger terminal granulocytic differentiation(51â€“54) and blocks monocytic differentiation program.(51,53) Conversely, inactivation of C/EBPÎ± in Cebpa knock-out mice showed profound defects in the granulocytic differentiation, while all other hematopoietic cells are present in normal number, indicating its critical role in the granulopoiesis.(55) Several lines of evidence suggest that mutations in CEBPA is one of the major molecular events that could cause myeloid malignancies. Ten per cent of patients with AML M1 or M2, according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification, without frequent cytogenetic abnormalities such as t(8;21)(q22;q22), carry heterozygous CEBPA gene mutations that result in truncated proteins with a dominant negative effects.(49,56,57) The RUNX1-ETO fusion protein generated by the t(8;21) translocation represses the transcription of CEBPA by suppressing its auto-regulatory loop in gene transcription,(48) while the PML-RARÎ± fusion protein generated by t(15;17)(q21;q22) inhibits the function of C/EBPÎ±.(58) We confirmed that RUNX1-EVI1 suppressed the differentiation of LG-3 cells that differentiate along the myeloid lineage upon exposure to G-CSF.(59) Coexpression of C/EBPÎ± restored the differentiation ability of the RUNX1-EVI1-expressing LG-3 cells. We also found that RUNX1-EVI1 associates with C/EBPÎ±. RUNX1-EVI1 suppresses C/EBPÎ±-mediated transcription of the CEBPA promoter in a CtBP-binding site-dependent fashion. In a gel-shift assay, RUNX1-EVI1 down-regulated the DNA-binding activity of C/EBPÎ±. Therefore, the recruitment of HDAC by RUNX1-EVI1 and interference with the DNA binding of C/EBPÎ± could be the mechanisms for the repression of C/EBPÎ± by RUNX1-EVI1. These results indicate that inhibition of C/EBPÎ± is related to the leukemogenic potential of RUNX1-EVI1. Helbling et al.(60) have reported that RUNX1-EVI1 represses C/EBPÎ± in a different way. They reported that RUNX1-EVI1 reduces the level of C/EBPÎ± protein but not the level of its mRNA in U937 cells and in leukemic blasts of patients carrying the RUNX1-EVI1 translocation, and that RUNX1-EVI1 up-regulates the expression of calreticulin, a putative inhibitor of CEBPÎ± translation. Calreticulin has calcium storage and chaperone function, and is postulated to be involved in the development of leukemia.(61) The small interference RNA (siRNA) against calreticulin showed that RUNX1-EVI1 inhibited C/EBPÎ± expression in a post-transcriptional mechanism through calreticulin. Biological function of RUNX1-EVI1  RUNX1-EVI1 transforms the most immature hematopoietic cells.â€‚ As described above, Senyuk et al. showed that RUNX1-EVI1 transforms primary murine bone marrow progenitors, depending on both of the CtBP-binding site and the second ZF domain.(45,62) Recently, Takeshita et al.(63) introduced RUNX1-EVI1 and its mutants in murine bone marrow cells and evaluated their transforming activities by colony replating assays. The transforming activity of RUNX1-EVI1 was lost when any of the known functional domains of EVI1, the first and the second ZF domains, AD at the C-terminus or CtBP-binding site, was deleted from the chimeric protein. Although RUNX1-EVI1 is known to repress function of wild-type RUNX1 dominantly, forced expression of EVI1 did not transform the Runx1â€“/â€“ bone marrow cells, indicating that the existence of RUNX1-EVI1 means more than a simple combination of the presence of EVI1 and the absence of RUNX1. Interestingly, unlike the MLL-ENL or RUNX1-ETO leukemia-related chimeric proteins, which transform hematopoietic progenitors, RUNX1-EVI1 transforms only the hematopoietic stem cell fraction (c-kit + Sca-1 + Linâ€“). Moreover, RUNX1-EVI1-transformed cells show a cell-marker profile distinct from that of the cells transformed by RUNX1-ETO, which also suppresses RUNX1 function. The nature of RUNX1-EVI1-leukemia as hematopoietic stem cell tumors might be a consequence of these oncogenic preference of RUNX1-EVI1. A bone marrow transplantation model.â€‚ Cuenco et al.(64) analyzed the effect of the human RUNX1-EVI1 fusion gene in mouse bone marrow cells using retroviral transduction system. Mice transplanted with RUNX1-EVI1-expressed bone marrow cells developed acute leukemia 5â€“13 months after the transplantation. The disease can be transferred into secondary recipient mice with a much shorter latency period. Morphological analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow smears demonstrated the presence of myeloid blast cells and immature cells differentiated into both myelocytic and monocytic lineages. Cytochemical and flow cytometric analysis confirmed that these mice had a disease recapitulating human AML. These observations indicate that the expression of RUNX1-EVI1 can induce AML in mice, with extended latency period suggesting a requirement for additional perturbations. A study by the same group has demonstrated a cooperation of BCR-ABL and RUNX1-EVI1 in blocking myeloid differentiation and rapid induction of AML in mouse model.(65) The study showed that RUNX1-EVI1 alone does not block myeloid differentiation in the mouse bone marrow during the 4 months of preleukemia stage, while coexpression of BCR-ABL and RUNX1-EVI1 can block myeloid differentiation and induce AML rapidly. They also showed that both RUNX1 and EVI1 portions are required for RUNX1-EVI1 to cooperate with BCR-ABL in the induction of AML in mice.(66)  Recently, it has been shown in a virus transduced experiment that mice transplanted with bone marrow cells expressing RUNX1 mutants developed MDS/AML within 4â€“13 months.(67) Interestingly, the analysis of the viral integration sites showed that EVI1 seemed to be a collaborating gene for the RUNX1(D171N) mutant for the induction of MDS/AML. The disease has common phenotype characterized by marked hepatosplenomegaly, myeloid dysplasia, leukocytosis and biphenotypic surface markers. The collaboration between RUNX1(D171N) and EVI1 was confirmed by a bone marrow transplant (BMT) model, where coexpression of RUNX1(D171N) and EVI1 induced acute leukemia of the same phenotype with much shorter latency. These results suggest that a combination of dominant-negative effect over RUNX1 and the oncogenic property of EVI1, both of which are components of RUNX1-EVI1, could cause MDS or MDS/AML without additional hits. It seems important that RUNX1 should not be inactivated completely in order to cooperate with EVI1, because expression of EVI1 did not transform the Runx1-deleted murine bone marrow cells.(63) Runx1-EVI1 knock-in mice.â€‚ We knocked-in the Runx1-EVI1 chimeric gene into the mouse Runx1 genomic locus to explore the effect of Runx1-EVI1 in developmental hematopoiesis in vivo.(68) Our knock-in expression of Runx1-EVI1 fusion gene results in embryonic lethality between E12.5 and E14.5, with CNS hemorrhage and a lack of fetal liver hematopoiesis. Post-enucleated erythrocytes were absent in the peripheral blood from E12.5 Runx1-EVI1/+ embryos, whereas nucleated erythroblasts were abundantly observed. These findings indicate that Runx1-EVI1/+heterozygous mice fail to establish definitive hematopoiesis in the fetal liver as Runx1â€“/â€“ mice. Therefore, RUNX1-EVI1 was first demonstrated to have in vivo dominant inhibitory effects over RUNX1. Electron microscopic examination of the E13.5 fetal liver showed that a fewer number of erythroid and myeloid progenitors, and dysplastic megakaryocytes that were defective for demarcation membrane exist in the Runx1-EVI1/+ fetal liver.  On in vitro hematopoietic colony forming assays, the fetal liver from E13.5 Runx1-EVI1/+embryos contained multilineage hematopoietic progenitors, while that from E12.5 Runx1â€“/â€“ embryos was reported to contain no definitive hematopoietic progenitors.(10,11) No erythroid colonies were seen in the livers at both E12.5 and E13.5. The CFU-GEMM-derived colonies from E13.5 Runx1-EVI1/+embryos included few erythroblasts, numerous agranular granulocytes with a delayed differentiation, and dysplastic megakaryocytes. Moreover, serial in vitro replating assays showed higher self-renewal capacity of hematopoietic progenitors in E13.5 Runx1-EVI1/+ fetal livers than that in wild-type fetal livers.  On semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method with fetal livers, the expression of Pu.1 mRNA in Runx1-EVI1/+fetal liver cells was comparable with that in the wild-type cells, whereas its expression level was markedly decreased in Runx1â€“/â€“ fetal liver cells, as has been reported previously.(69) The maintained expression of PU.1 in Runx1-EVI1/+fetal liver cells may support the survival of their multilineage hematopoietic progenitors up to E13.5, and enhance their monocyte/macrophage lineage differentiation. These differences in gene expression pattern provide logical explanation for the distinct hematopoietic capacity between Runx1â€“/â€“ and Runx1-EVI1/+ fetal liver cells. These data suggest that the sufficient expression of the Pu.1 gene is the prerequisite for definitive hematopoiesis in the fetal liver. Runx1-EVI1 knock-in chimeric mice.â€‚ Of the six chimeric mice created, one mouse which died at 5 months of age showed marked hepatosplenomegaly. Wright-Giemsa staining of stump preparation from the enlarged spleen demonstrated massive infiltration of large dysplastic cells, some of which contained multilobulated nuclei with various size of cytoplasm reminiscent of megakaryoblastic leukemia.(70) Histology section showed disrupted gross architecture of the spleen, with white and red pulp intermingling, and the electron microscopic analysis of the infiltrating cells in the spleen showed 20% of the cells positive for platelet-peroxidase, indicating that this chimeric mouse developed megakaryoblastic leukemia. The important aspect of our observation is that RUNX1-EVI1 protein could be leukemogenic per se, in contract to RUNX1-ETO, which requires additional hits to induce leukemia.(70â€“72) This clear difference in the pathophysiological outcome likely arises from the EVI1 portion of RUNX1-EVI1 protein. Oncogenic functions of EVI1 described above may cause stronger oncogenic capacity of RUNX1-EVI1 than RUNX1-ETO. Another important aspect is that the affected lineage in human leukemia is recapitulated in the experimental animal. Our observation indicates strong causal relationship between the expression of RUNX1-EVI1 protein and megakaryoblastic leukemia. Indeed, the RUNX1-EVI1 chimeric gene was isolated from a patient developing megakaryoblastic crisis in chronic myelocytic leukemia with additional chromosome t(3;21). Clinical aspects  As mentioned above, the major leukemogenic effect of RUNX1-EVI1 is through HDAC-recruitment via CtBP (Fig. 3). Thus repression of HDAC activity is thought to suppress oncogenic effect of RUNX1-EVI1. HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) are the member of a new class of chemical agents that epigenetically modulate gene transcription by enhancing the acetylation of core nucleosomal histones and are expected to be promising anticancer agents against various types of tumors. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (vorinostat), one of the newly synthesized HDACi, is the most clinically successful HDACi that controls cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) effectively.(73) Conventional HDACi, such as valproic acid and butylate, are also reported to be effective in treating some types of hematological malignancies in clinical trials. Recently, we have reported that HDACi (trichostatin A and VPA) triggers apoptosis in human leukemic cell lines expressing RUNX1-related chimeric proteins such as RUNX1-ETO, TEL-RUNX1 or RUNX1-EVI1.(74) A cell line without RUNX1-related chimeras is less affected by the HDACi treatment. These data suggest that HDACi seems to be an attractive choice in the molecular targeting therapy of RUNX1-EVI1-expressing leukemia.  Figure 3.  Figure 3. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide RUNX1-EVI1 is a multifunctional oncoprotein. RUNX1-EVI1 exerts oncogenic function through three pathways: dominant-negative effect over RUNX1, repression of TGFÎ² signaling and inhibition of C/EBPÎ± activity. Another potential therapeutic agent targeted to RUNX1-EVI1 is arsenic trioxide (ATO). Shackelford et al.(75) found that ATO degrades RUNX1-EVI1. The ATO treatment induces the differentiation and apoptosis of RUNX1-EVI1-expressing leukemic cells in vitro and elongates the survival of mice transplanted with these cells in vivo. They also demonstrated that ATO targets RUNX1-EVI1 via two moieties, MDS1 and EVI1 moieties. The EVI1 induces a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and MDS1 induces a proteasome-independent pathway. With abundant experiences of clinical use in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia, ATO could be used clinically as a targeted therapy for RUNX1-EVI1-positive human leukemia. Summary  The fusion protein RUNX1-EVI1 is a multifunctional protein demonstrated by its diverse role in regulating differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and self-renewal capacity. It functions as a dominant-negative suppressor of RUNX1 and has oncogenic properties of EVI1. There is no doubt that RUNX1-EVI1 plays a major role in t(3;21)-related MDS and MDS/AML. It remains to be determined whether RUNX1-EVI1 induces leukemia by itself, or needs additional genetic events. A conditional knock-in experiment of the RUNX1-EVI1 gene would help clarify this question.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;Balanced chromosomal translocations are frequently associated with haematopoietic neoplasms and often involve genes that encode transcription factors, which play critical roles in normal haematopoiesis. Fusion oncoproteins that arise from chimeric genes generated by such translocations are usually stable and consistent molecular markers for a given disease subtype and contribute to the leukaemogenic processes. The t(12;21)(p13;q22) chromosomal translocation is the most frequent illegitimate gene recombination in paediatric cancer, occurring in approximately 25% of common (c) B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (cALL) cases. The rearrangement results in the in-frame fusion of the 5&#x27; region of the ETS-related gene, TEL (ETV6), to almost the entire AML1 (RUNX1) locus and is associated with favourable prognosis following conventional therapeutic strategies. We discuss here the prenatal origins of the TEL/AML1 translocation as an initiating mutation, the role of TEL-AML1 in cellular transformation and the molecular mechanisms by which the chimeric protein imposes altered patterns of gene expression.  Keywords: prenatal, co-repressor, histone deacetylase, translocation Top of page Introduction Acute leukaemia is a disease characterized by acquired mutations and clonal expansion of a transformed haematopoietic cell with progeny arrested at some stage of differentiation. Stem cells are considered to be the likely venue for the initial transforming events (Bonnet and Dick, 1997; Greaves and Wiemels, 2003). In contrast to the epithelial carcinomas, mutations in haematological malignancies frequently involve balanced or reciprocal chromosomal translocations (Rowley, 1998). These exchanges produce illegitimate recombination of gene loci leading to either deregulated expression of a proto-oncogene or expression of a chimeric fusion gene product with properties different from its wild-type counterparts (Rabbitts, 1994; Look, 1997). Broadly speaking, the functional consequences of fusion gene formation are activation/constitutive kinase activation (e.g. BCR-ABL) or the altered transcriptional regulation. Genes that are critical to stem cell development or lineage specification in haematopoiesis are major targets for corruption by gene fusion in leukaemia (Enver and Greaves, 1998). Genes, such as AML1 (RUNX1), RARalpha, MLL and TEL (ETV6), have been found rearranged with multiple different partners in distinct types of lymphoid and myeloid leukaemias (Tenen et al., 1997; Rowley, 1998). These so-called class II mutations (Speck and Gilliland, 2002) result in the expression of chimeric transcription factors, which block differentiation and apoptosis by interfering with the function of their wild-type counterparts. For example, in APL, the PML-RARalpha chimeric protein blocks differentiation and cell death by interfering with RARalpha and PML signalling, respectively (He et al., 1999; Rego et al., 2001). Although required, class II mutations are thought to be insufficient for leukaemogenesis, and recent studies suggest that at the minimum cooperation with growth-promoting tyrosine kinase (TK) mutations (class I), such as FLT3 or RAS, is necessary for the development of a fully malignant disease (Speck and Gilliland, 2002).  Chromosomal translocations involving either the AML1 or TEL gene constitute some of the most frequently observed genetic aberrations in a variety of different myeloid and lymphoid leukaemias (Rowley, 1998; Greaves, 1999). The AML1 or RUNX1 gene, which encodes a transcription factor with a DNA-binding domain (DBD) related to Drosophila Runt (and other proteins of the RUNX family), was first identified through its fusion with the ETO gene in t(8;21)(q22;q22)-associated acute myeloid leukaemia (Miyoshi et al., 1991; Erickson et al., 1992; Nisson et al., 1992; Miyoshi et al., 1993). Subsequently, AML1 was found to be involved in other leukaemogenic translocations, t(16;21), t(12;21) and t(3;21), which involved ETO-related MTG16 (Gamou et al., 1998), TEL (Golub et al., 1995; Romana et al., 1995a) and EVI1 (Mitani et al., 1994) genes, respectively, and cytogenetic analyses of cells derived from a variety of myeloid malignancies have indicated the possible existence of additional AML1 partner genes (Roulston et al., 1998). Heritable mutations in the AML1 RUNT DBD were also found to be associated with familial platelet disorder and predisposition to acute myelogenous leukaemia (Osato et al., 1999; Song et al., 1999). The TEL gene, on the other hand, encodes an ETS family transcription factor identified by its fusion with the PDGFRbeta locus in cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia with t(5;12)(q33;p13) (Golub et al., 1994). Subsequently, in a variety of haematopoietic neoplasms, TEL has been found rearranged with a number of different genes (Golub et al., 1996b), including those encoding other TKs, such as ABL (Papadopoulos et al., 1995) or JAK2 (Lacronique et al., 1997; Peeters et al., 1997), and the transcription factor AML1 (Romana et al., 1995a; Shurtleff et al., 1995).  The t(12;21)(p13;q22) chromosomal translocation, which fuses the TEL and AML1 genes is the most common structural chromosomal alteration in paediatric cancer and occurs in approximately 25% of paediatric common or B-cell precursor cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (cALL) cases (Romana et al., 1995b; Fears et al., 1996). It is considerably less prevalent in adult cALL (approx3%) and, to date, absent from other subtypes of leukaemia. The leukaemia-associated TEL-AML1 chimeric protein consists of the TEL sequences situated amino-terminal to the ETS DBD and all known functional regions of AML1 (see Figure 1 for schematic representation), including its RUNT DBD (Golub et al., 1996a; Berger, 1997). In this respect, TEL-AML1 is structurally distinct from other AML1 fusion proteins, which retain only the amino-terminal RUNT domain and not the C-terminal regulatory sequences of AML1.  Figure 1.

These data derive from studies of identical twins with concordant ALL (Greaves et al., 2003) and retrospective screening of archived neonatal blood spots of children diagnosed with ALL (Greaves and Wiemels, 2003). These analyses required prior identification of genomic breakpoints in TEL and AML1 for individual patient samples by long distance PCR methods (Wiemels and Greaves, 1999). Breakpoints are scattered throughout the 12 kb intron 5 of TEL and the approx100 kb intron 1 on AML1 (Figure 2). Statistically, there is some degree of microclustering (Wiemels et al., 2000), but critically, each patient&#x27;s leukaemic cells have unique, or clonotypic, breakpoints (arrowed in Figure 2a). The sharing of the same unique clonotypic TEL-AML1 genomic breakpoints and fusion sequences between twins (and that are acquired not constitutive) (see Figure 2b) indicates a single-cell origin. Concordance of disease then arises via spread of clonal progeny from one twin, in which the translocation arises, to the other prenatally via vascular anastomoses within a monochorionic placenta (Greaves et al., 2003). The identification of clonotypic TEL-AML1 genomic sequences in neonatal blood spots (Wiemels et al., 1999a; Maia et al., 2001; Hjalgrim et al., 2002) provides direct evidence for the existence of the fusion gene at birth. These data are endorsed by the detection of putative preleukaemic B-lineage cells in normal cord blood that harbour TEL/AML1 translocations (Mori et al., 2002) (see Figure 3). These studies collectively provide a compelling argument for TEL-AML1 arising as a very early event in leukaemogenesis, and although it cannot be proven unequivocally, it may well be the first or initiating event in most cases.

Cell on the right is positive for the TEL/AML1 translocation (red+green=yellow fusion gene)  Full figure and legend (76K)  Additional observations from the above studies indicate that although TEL-AML1 may be linked to early preleukaemia clonal expansion, it is insufficient for overt ALL. First, the protracted postnatal interval, or latency, before disease diagnosis can be up to a decade or more (Wiemels et al., 1999b; Maia et al., 2004) and concordance rates in twins are modest at approx10% (Greaves et al., 2003). This suggests that additional or secondary and complementary genetic events are required. Second, the frequency of &#x27;functional&#x27; TEL-AML1 fusions in normal newborns is approx100 times the leukaemia rate (Mori et al., 2002). This interpretation accords with conventional wisdom in two- or multistep models of cancer clone evolution (Knudson, 1992; Vogelstein and Kinzler, 1993) and also fits with results from transgenic modelling with fusion genes (see below).  There might not be an exclusive second genetic &#x27;hit&#x27;, but at diagnosis most cases of ALL with TEL-AML1 fusions have deletion of the nonrearranged or normal TEL allele. Deletions are subclonal to TEL-AML1 fusions (Romana et al., 1996) and are distinct in their genomic boundaries in twins (Maia et al., 2001), and in relapse versus diagnostic samples from the same individuals (Ford et al., 2001). TEL deletions are therefore likely to be postnatal secondary events, albeit a common and integral component of the molecular pathogenesis of cALL (Greaves et al., 2003). Deletion of normal TEL must have some potent selective advantage in cells carrying TEL-AML1 fusions, which might relate either to a suppressor function of TEL (Fenrick et al., 2000; Rompaey et al., 2000) and/or to the ability of normal TEL protein to dimerize with TEL-AML1 and reduce its transforming activity (McLean et al., 1996; Lopez et al., 1999). One intriguing proposal, with therapeutic implications, is that fusion genes encoding hybrid transcription factors such as TEL-AML1 also require genetic complementation with mutant or activated kinases (Speck and Gilliland, 2002). Activated kinases could interfere with the cell cycle and complement the differentiation-blocking activity of chimeric transcription factors. Whether TEL deletion itself is sufficient to dysregulate the cell cycle in this way remains to be assessed. In acute leukaemias initiated by other gene fusions, including MLL fusions and AML1-ETO, FLT-3 kinase mutations do seem to provide complementary genetic events (Gilliland and Griffin, 2002; Armstrong et al., 2003; Taketani et al., 2004).  Collectively, these data are compatible with a minimal two-step model for the pathogenesis of childhood ALL and AML, in which chimeric fusion genes provide the first or initiating hit (Figure 4). Note that for infant ALL with MLL fusions, this evolutionary process must be greatly abbreviated (Greaves et al., 2003).  Figure 4.

However, this begs the question of what causes the initial DNA damage. For MLL gene fusions, there is experimental (Strick et al., 2000), genetic (Wiemels et al., 1999c; Smith et al., 2002) and epidemiologic (Alexander et al., 2001) evidence that transplacental chemical carcinogenesis may be involved. However, what might be responsible for the relatively high frequency (approx1%) of TEL-AML1 fusion generation in normal foetal haematopoiesis? Presumably, nonfunctional fusions (in nonstem cells) occur at an even higher rate. One possibility is that these are &#x27;normal&#x27; developmental errors of DNA maintenance reflecting the complexity of embryo and foetal tissue engineering in which cell death, DNA damage and oxidative stress are ubiquitous (Greaves, 1988; Greaves and Wiemels, 2003). The initiation of other paediatric cancers has similarly been ascribed to developmental accidents (Maris and Denny, 2002). Even if TEL-AML1 fusion is, in effect, a spontaneous error, the risk of this event occurring may be modified by other factors. There is dietary (Thompson et al., 2001) and genetic (Wiemels et al., 2001) evidence that folate has an impact on the risk of infant and childhood leukaemia, and this could well be operative during pregnancy in utero, influencing the likelihood of chromosomal breaks (Greaves and Wiemels, 2003).  Whatever the mechanisms governing chromosomal changes in utero, it is evident that for most cases of childhood leukaemia, the crucial aetiologic bottleneck (Figure 4) is the postnatal &#x27;promotional&#x27; events or exposures that precipitate the secondary genetic changes, including TEL deletion. Uncovering the nature of these exposures is the objective of major case/control epidemiologic studies in Europe and the US. Although no consensus view has yet emerged, there is now a body of evidence implicating infections in childhood ALL (Greaves, 1997).  Top of page Cell biology and animal models Understanding the nature of the cellular compartments targeted by leukaemogenic fusion proteins is of fundamental importance both with respect to appreciating the underlying biology of the disease as well as in its treatment (Hope et al., 2003; Grimwade and Enver, 2004). An emerging view is that leukaemia represents a dysregulated stem cell-derived clone. Dick and co-workers have provided such a model for AML (Lapidot et al., 1994; Bonnet and Dick, 1997). In this scenario, rare self-renewing CD34+,CD38- cells retain tumorigenic potential and give rise, through limited differentiation, to the bulk of the leukaemic cells, which display a more mature myeloid phenotype. The CD34+CD38- cells may therefore be considered to be both the initial &#x27;target&#x27; cells and the &#x27;cancer stem cells&#x27; driving and sustaining the disease. Thus they represent the key cellular targets for therapy. While similar considerations clearly apply to CML as a stem cell disease, the case of TEL-AML1-associated cALL is less clear. The overall or &#x27;bulk&#x27; phenotype of the leukaemia in children is of an early CD19-positive B-cell progenitor. Attempts to identify the earliest cell, which harbours the TEL/AML1 translocation, have proved technically difficult due the limited numbers of cells that are available from patients. This caveat aside, attempts so far have only detected the fusion gene in CD19-positive cells with CD34+/CD19- cells scoring negative (Hotfilder et al., 2002; Mori et al., 2002). This would be compatible with TEL-AML1 arising in an early B-lineage committed progenitor/stem cell (Greaves and Wiemels, 2003). However, these data do not necessarily exclude the more primitive CD34-positive stem cell compartment as a cellular target for the initiating translocation.  Experimental modelling of TEL-AML1-associated disease in animals has also provided insight into the cell biology of TEL-AML1-associated cALL. Expression of the TEL-AML1 gene as a transgene in vivo under the control of the B-cell-specific IGH enhancer failed to cause leukaemia (Andreasson et al., 2001; T Ford, T Enver and M Greaves unpublished observations). This may reflect failure to express appropriate levels of the protein. Alternatively, and more probably, it may reflect a requirement for expression in a developmentally more primitive cell compartment and/or the absence of cooperating secondary mutations. In this latter regard, the experiments of Friedman and co-workers are informative (Bernardin et al., 2002). These workers transduced stem cells with TEL-AML1 containing retroviruses and subsequently transplanted these cells into syngeneic hosts. Transplantation of TEL-AML1-transduced bone marrow cells from a p16/p19- deficient mouse resulted in a high frequency of leukaemia (of unspecified phenotype), which occurred with a relatively short latency. While these results indicate the need for cooperating genetic lesions in TEL-AML1-associated leukaemogenesis, the relevance of this particular combination of mutations in the context of TEL-AML1-associated cALL is unclear. Recently, Tsuzuki et al. (2004) have used a similar experimental approach but focused on identifying the early or preleukaemic effects of TEL-AML1 expression. TEL-AML1 expression was found to inhibit B-cell differentiation leading to an accumulation of early B-cell progenitors and a corresponding deficit in mature B cells. Detailed examination of this partial differentiation arrest reveals effects from the very earliest pro-B cells in the mouse. The size of the haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment was also larger in these animals and furthermore continued to increase with time. This raises the possibility that this very primitive compartment may be responsible for the maintenance and/or expansion of a preleukaemic clone, at least in this model. Despite some increase in myeloid progenitor activity, no block to myeloid differentiation was observed. Overall, this preleukaemic phenotype displays many of the features seen in the common precursor B-cell ALL. Thus, there is (i) a selective differentiation block in the B-cell pathway; (ii) in both cases the block is at an early progenitor cell level (although differences in murine and human B-lymphoid development complicate direct comparison (Ghia et al., 1998)); and (iii) the differentiation block is incomplete, resulting in the presence of mature B cells in both cases (Mori et al., 2002). B-cell-specific results have also been reported by Williams and co-workers (Morrow et al., 2004), who have analysed the effects of enforced expression of TEL-AML1 in foetal liver-derived progenitors. They observed enhanced self-renewal capacity of B-cell progenitors evidenced by increased replating efficiency in colony-forming assays in vitro and an increased repopulating activity on competitive reconstitution assays in vivo. Despite these broad similarities, some detailed aspects of these two murine models (e.g. differentiation block at the B precursor stage) appear different. While this will require further investigation, it seems likely that the use of developmentally distinct stem cell populations in these two studies may be, in some part, accountable for any differences observed. Collectively, however, these studies endorse the view that TEL-AML1 oncoprotein can transform early B-lineage progenitors and initiate a preleukaemia condition.  These results parallel the impact of AML1-ETO on early myeloid cell self-renewal and differentiation (Higuchi et al., 2002; Schwieger et al., 2002). Thus, while expressions of both AML1-ETO and TEL-AML1 within the stem cell compartment appear to inhibit differentiation, the activities of the two molecules appear to be broadly selective for myeloid and B-lymphoid lineages, respectively, and are consistent with the lineage selectivity seen in t(8;21)- and t(12;21)- associated leukaemias. The data argue that this striking feature of fusion genes arises not because of a restrictive cell of origin of chromosome translocation itself, but rather as a consequence of cell context-dependent function of the encoded chimeric proteins (Barr, 1998). It is therefore important to understand how these different chimeric fusions involving AML1-regulated transcription function at the molecular level. One possibility supported by the available molecular evidence (see below) is that TEL-AML1 functions to interfere with normal AML1 activity. While it has been appreciated for some time that AML1 is expressed in most blood cell types including B-lymphocytes, most attention has focused on its role in the specification of HSC, during ontogeny (Okuda et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1996). Most recently its role in adult haematopoiesis has been addressed using a conditional knockout approach (Ichikawa et al., 2004). These studies reveal that AML1 function is not required for the maintenance and self-renewal of HSC, but is required for B-lymphoid differentiation. In addition, loss of AML1 activity results in an increase in multipotent progenitors. These effects are similar to those seen as a result of enforced TEL-AML1 expression (Tsuzuki et al., 2004), and are therefore consistent with the notion that TEL-AML1 functions as an antagonist of endogenous AML1 activity.  Top of page Molecular mechanisms of TEL-AML1 action Over the past decade results of many studies have highlighted the importance of chromatin-modifying and -remodelling complexes in regulation of gene transcription (Kingston et al., 1996; Kadonaga, 1998). Through the recruitment of such complexes DNA-binding trans-acting factors can alter the surrounding nucleosomal structure and either activate or repress transcription from adjacent promoter(s). Whether a given gene is expressed or not (and the level of expression) depends to a large extent on the nature of histone modifications (- the histone code), including methylation and acetylation, which are imposed at its regulatory regions through combinatorial action of transcription factor complexes (Fischle et al., 2003). Consistent with early findings that histone hyper- and hypoacetylation is linked to transcriptionally active and silent chromatin, respectively (Vidali et al., 1978), many transcriptional activators and repressors, including leukaemia-associated fusion oncoproteins, have been shown to recruit cofactors with intrinsic and/or associated histone acetyltransferases (HATs, coactivators) and deacetylases (HDACs, corepressors) (Grunstein, 1997; Hassig and Schreiber, 1998). AML1 has been shown to function as a DNA-binding transcriptional activator required for the expression of genes whose products are associated with blood cell development, such as TCRdelta (Hernandez-Munain and Krangel, 1994), interleukin-3 (Uchida et al., 1997) and PU.1 transcription factor (Okada et al., 1998). Activation of gene expression by AML1 and its positive role in myeloid cell differentiation has been correlated with its ability to interact with the p300 HAT (Kitabayashi et al., 1998).  A number of previous studies have also suggested that, in a specific promoter and/or cell context, AML1 can function as a transcriptional repressor (Takahashi et al., 1995). The carboxy-terminal VWRPY motif of AML1 can interact (Aronson et al., 1997; Levanon et al., 1998) with Groucho-related corepressors, TLE1-4 (Fisher and Caudy, 1998; Imai et al., 1998). The mechanism of transcriptional repression by the Groucho family of proteins may also, at least in part, be mediated through HDACs (Chen et al., 1999). AML1 can also interact with mSin3A corepressor and HDACs (Fenrick et al., 1999; Guidez et al., 1999; Lutterbach et al., 2000; Petrie et al., 2003). Since the VWRPY motif is not required for this interaction, it is likely that in addition to repression through the Groucho related proteins, AML1 may also repress transcription through recruitment of mSin3A/HDAC complexes. The particular mode of repression, or AML1 action in general, could be specific to different target genes and be subject to regulation through post-translational protein modification and/or interaction with other factors (see Figure 5a). Consistent with the above, association mSin3A with AML1 is regulated by phosphorylation (Imai et al., 2004). When AML1 is phosphorylated on specific serine residues by extracellular signal-regulated kinases, which positively regulate its transcriptional activity, it dissociates from mSin3A and no longer colocalizes with the corepressor in nuclear matrix. These results could suggest that target genes for AML1 repressor are distinct from those that are activated by AML1. However, one cannot exclude that translocation from nuclear matrix may involve DNA-bound AML1/promoter complex.  Figure 5. Figure 5 - Unfortunately we are unable to provide accessible alternative text for this. If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author A hypothetical model for the molecular mechanism of TEL-AML1 action. (a) AML1 is a factor whose transcription activating and repressing abilities depend on recruitment of p300 and mSin3A/HDAC, respectively, and are regulated by some, as yet, poorly defined processes (phosphorylation, for example). Binding of AML1 to its target genes is shown to occur in association with its regulatory subunit CBFbeta. When associated with mSin3A, AML1 represses transcription through indirect recruitment of HDAC which removes the acetyl groups (Ac) from lysine residues located in amino-terminal tails of histones (H3 and H4), thus allowing for the formation of compact or repressed chromatin and markedly reducing accessibility of a given promoter to basal transcriptional machinery. Given an appropriate stimulus, the above process is reversed as AML1 dissociates from mSin3A/HDAC and associates with p300 HAT. Association of AML1 with either mSin3A or p300 may also dependent on the context of the regulatory region of a given AML1 target gene. This model does not exclude the possibility that AML1 can repress transcription through other corepressors, such as Groucho/TLE, which for simplicity are not indicated. (b) In the case of TEL-AML1, the abilities of TEL moiety to dimerize and to bind N-CoR and mSin3A corepressors allow for the formation of a very stable repressor complex and renders the chimeric protein, which includes the DNA-binding Runt domain of AML1, resistant to the regulation depicted in (a). Therefore, the TEL-AML1 fusion protein that retains the ability to bind the AML1 target sequences has a potential to function as a constitutive HDAC-dependent repressor causing deregulation of AML1 target genes. Although p300 may be still capable of association with the AML1 moiety of the TEL-AML1, its HAT activity would likely not function correctly in the context of the fusion protein. Owing to the TEL dimerization/oligomerization PD, the TEL-AML1 fusion protein binds to the AML1 target sequences as a homodimer or an oligomer (not shown). The functional requirements of CBFbeta for DNA binding of TEL-AML1 dimers or oligomers to AML1 binding sites are not clear (?)  Full figure and legend (188K)  In contrast to AML1, transiently expressed TEL-AML1 fusion proteins generally repress the activities of reporter constructs driven by regulatory regions derived from haematopoietic-specific genes and/or antagonize their AML1-dependent activation (Hiebert et al., 1996; Fears et al., 1997). Work from a number of laboratories has shown that the transcriptional activities of TEL-AML1 involve recruitment of nuclear receptor corepressor/HDAC complexes to the TEL moiety of the fusion protein (Chakrabarti and Nucifora, 1999; Fenrick et al., 1999; Guidez et al., 2000). Similar findings have been reported for other AML1 fusion proteins (see other articles in this issue). Consistent with such results, TEL-AML1-mediated repression can be relieved by HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin A (Fenrick et al., 1999; Guidez et al., 1999).  Given that AML1 may function as a regulated transcription factor, the fusion of its DBD with TEL sequences would convert it to an HDAC-dependent constitutive repressor and contribute to leukaemogenesis via imposition of an altered pattern of AML1 target gene expression (see model in Figure 5). In order to bind effectively to its DNA target sites, AML1 needs to dimerize with a non-DNA-binding regulatory protein CBFbeta (Meyers et al., 1993; Ogawa et al., 1993; Wang et al., 1993), which is itself encoded by a gene disrupted by a recurrent chromosomal rearrangement, inv(16), in acute myeloid leukaemia (Liu et al., 1993). It remains to be shown whether in the context of the TEL-AML1 (or other AML1 fusions) CBFbeta is required for the stability of RUNT domain and efficient DNA binding. The wild-type TEL, on the other hand, can self-associate via its PD domain and is thought to form dimers or oligomers (Jousset et al., 1997; Lopez et al., 1999; Mavrothalassitis and Ghysdael, 2000). PD of TEL appears to be required for repression, however, it is unclear whether this region acts as a repressor domain or whether dimerization/oligomerization of TEL is required for affective association of corepressors and transcriptional repression of target sequences. PD can interact with mSin3A and a central repression domain, located between PD and ETS DBD, has been shown to interact with N-CoR and HDACs (Fenrick et al., 1999; Guidez et al., 2000; Wang and Hiebert, 2001; Petrie et al., 2003). It is likely that oligomerization of TEL allows for stable formation of repressorâ€“corepressor complexes as replacement of TEL PD with a heterologous dimerization/oligomerization domain restores its ability to repress transcription from a cotransfected reporter constructs (Mavrothalassitis and Ghysdael, 2000). In this respect, it is worth noting that recent results have also indicated that the mechanism of inv(16) generated CBFbeta-SMMHC fusion oncoprotein action may be to stabilise the association of the corepressor complex with the AML1 protein (Lutterbach et al., 1999).  In addition to corepressor/HDAC recruitment acquisition of TEL sequences by AML1 moiety of the fusion protein (see Figure 5) may have additional functional consequences. For example, dimerization or oligomerization of AML1 RUNT DBD via the amino-terminal TEL could allow for higher affinity binding to multiple AML1 DNA-binding sites than for monomeric RUNT domain, thus antagonizing action of the wild-type AML1. Higher affinity for multiple AML1 binding sites has been demonstrated for AML1-ETO (Bushweller et al., 2003). This property is thought to account for the observed dominant-negative effects of AML1-ETO on function of AML1 in haematopoietic development (Yergeau et al., 1997; Okuda et al., 1998).  Top of page Therapeutic implications Important therapeutic implications of these functional insights are that agents capable of inhibiting enzymatic components of the corepressor complexes could potentially revert the differentiation blocks imposed by TEL-AML1 and other fusion gene encoded oncoproteins. Although ALL with TEL-AML1 is usually a low-risk disease, it too could benefit from novel, less toxic therapies targeting activity of the chimeric protein, particularly in low proportion of more difficult and/or relapsed cases. Addition of HDAC inhibitors and/or other agents that relief transcriptional repression (DNA demethylating agent 5-azacytidine, for example) with current therapies may allow for dose reduction and hence lower therapeutic toxicities of currently used drugs. This view is consistent with results indicating that treatment intensity may affect outcome of the patients with cALL (Takahashi et al., 1998). Such combinatorial therapies may also more effectively target the premalignant clone, thus reducing the likelihood of a relapsed disease. In this context, there is evidence based on TEL deletion analysis (Ford et al., 2001) and IGG clonotypic sequences (Konrad et al., 2003) that &#x27;late&#x27; relapses, that is, off treatment, in this leukaemia may derive from a persistent, therapy-resistant TEL-AML1 preleukaemic clone. Late relapses of TEL-AML1-positive ALL are very rare in the Dana Farber chemotherapy protocol that includes high-dose l-asparaginase as part of the intensification regime (McLean et al., 1996). Correspondingly, ALL blast cells with TEL-AML1 are known to be selectively sensitive in vitro to this drug (Ramakers-van Woerden et al., 2000).&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;The BCR-ABL fusion protein generated by t(9;22)(q34;q11) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of the myeloproliferative disorder status at the chronic phase of the disease, but progression from the chronic phase to blast crisis (BC) is believed to require additional mutations. To explore the underlying mechanisms for BC, which is characterized by a blockage of blood cell differentiation, we screened several genes crucial to hematopoiesis and identified 10 types of mutations in RUNX1 among 11 of 85 (12.9%) patients with acute transformation of CML. Most of the mutations occurred in the runt homology domain, including H78Q, W79C, R139G, D171G, R174Q, L71fs-ter94, and V91fs-ter94. Further studies indicated that RUNX1 mutants not only exhibited decreased transactivation activity but also had an inhibitory effect on the WT RUNX1. To investigate the leukemogenic effect of mutated RUNX1, H78Q and V91fs-ter94 were transduced into 32D cells or BCR-ABLâ€“harboring murine cells, respectively. Consistent with the myeloblastic features of advanced CML patients with RUNX1 mutations, H78Q and V91fs-ter94 disturbed myeloid differentiation and induced a BC or accelerated phaseâ€“like phenotype in mice. These results suggest that RUNX1 abnormalities may promote acute myeloid leukemic transformation in a subset of CML patients.  Introduction  Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of the hematopoietic stem cells that typically progresses from a relatively benign chronic phase (CP), which is characterized by massive accumulation of mature granulocytes, to an accelerated phase (AP), and ultimately into terminal blast crisis (BC), which resembles acute leukemia characterized by the rapid expansion of myeloid or lymphoid blasts resulting from a blockage of cell differentiation. Disease progression can usually be blocked or slowed down by tyrosine kinase inhibition therapy or allogeneic transplantation. Survival outcomes plummet from CP (80%) to AP (50%) and then to BC (20%), indicating that current therapies work much better in CP than in AP or BC.1â‡“â€“3 Therefore, it is important to clarify the mechanism of BC with an emphasis on those genes or pathways which may be future targets for predictive markers or treatment of CML progression.  Greater than 95% of CML cases are associated with the presence of the hallmark chromosomal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) (ie, the Philadelphia or Ph chromosome).4 A large body of evidence has suggested that the initial event in CML pathogenesis is the acquisition of BCR-ABL, which causes not only a substantial expansion of terminally differentiated neutrophils, but also an instability of the genome.5 Progression to BC is accompanied by a severe blockage in hematopoietic cell differentiation and is thought to require additional mutations other than BCR-ABL. Additional genetic abnormalities have been reported to be associated with CML progression, including chromosomal changes such as a â€œdoubleâ€� Ph chromosome, isochromosome i(17q), trisomy 8, trisomy 19, loss of chromosome 9, t(3;21)(q26;q22) generating RUNX1/MDS1/EVI1, t(7;11)(p15;p15) generating NUP98/HOXA9, and mutations in tumor-suppressor genes such as p53, INK4A/ARF, and RB.5,6 Coexpression of RUNX1/MDS1/EVI1 or NUP98/HOXA9 with BCR-ABL can block myeloid differentiation and induce an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mice, suggesting that the induction of AML involves cooperation between mutations that dysregulate protein tyrosine kinase signaling and those that disrupt hematopoietic transcriptional regulation.7,8  The RUNX1 gene, a transcription factor (TF) located on chromosome 21q22, encodes the major Î±-subunit of the heterodimeric core binding factor (CBF) complex, which consists of the interacting RUNX1 and the Î²-subunit of CBF (CBFÎ²)9 and has been shown to be essential for normal hematopoiesis. Both RUNX1 and CBFÎ² are among the most frequent targets in leukemia through chromosomal translocations or gene mutations.10,11 With regard to the RUNX1 gene, different chromosomal translocations have been reported in human acute leukemias such as t(8;21)(q22;q22) generating the RUNX1-ETO fusion gene, t(12;21)(p12;q22) generating the TEL-RUNX1 fusion transcript, and the t(3,21)(q26;q22) generating the RUNX1/MDS1/EVI1 fusion gene. The RUNX1 protein contains, from N-terminal to C-terminal, 3 main domains: the conserved runt homology domain (RHD), the transcriptional activation domain (TAD), and the transcription repression domain (TRD).12 RUNX1 abnormalities have also been identified in some cases of secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), de novo AML, and treatment-related AML with acquired trisomy 21.10,13,14 RUNX1 mutations were found in 5 of 18 patients with advanced CML presenting with acquired trisomy 21.15 Recently, Grossmann et al reported a high incidence of RUNX1 mutations in CML-BC.16 However, the clinical significance of the RUNX1 mutations in advanced CML needs to be further explored with data from more populations and through in-depth biologic investigation. To evaluate the role of RUNX1 mutations as an additional genetic event in the pathogenesis of acute transformation of CML, we analyzed the entire coding region of the RUNX1 gene in a large cohort of Chinese CML-AP/BC patients (N = 85) with distinct AML subtype harboring BCR-ABL, and addressed the leukemogenic potential of these mutations. Interestingly, coexpression of BCR-ABL and 2 representative RUNX1 mutants resulted in the myeloid progenitors acquiring unusual growth advantages in vitro and induced the AML phenotype in mice. Our results indicate that RUNX1 abnormalities might be closely correlated with BC/AP progression in a subset of CML patients.  Methods  Patients  Clinical information for the patients in the study was described previously.17 Retrospectively, 85 advanced CML patients (n = 28 CML-AP and n = 57 CML-BC patients) were examined. Criteria for AP were 10%-20% blast cells in the BM, thrombocytopenia, and resistance to therapy; for BC, they were â‰¥ 20% blasts in the blood or BM with extramedullary blast infiltrates.  Sequencing of cDNA and genomic DNA of the RUNX1 gene  Experiments screening for RUNX1 mutations were as described previously.17  Plasmid constructions  The retroviral vectors murine stem cell virus (MSCV)â€“internal ribosome entry site (IRES)â€“green fluorescent protein (GFP) and MSCV-BCR-ABL-IRES-GFP were kindly provided by Dr Warren S. Pear (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). The MSCV-IRES-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) vector was constructed as described previously.18 cDNAs containing full-length wild-type (WT) or mutated RUNX1 were obtained by RT-PCR on BM samples. The integrity of the amplified sequences was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Whereas EcoRI and BglII were used for molecular cloning of different RUNX1 sequences into the pflag-CMV-4 expression vector (Sigma-Aldrich), EcoRI and XhoI were used to clone these sequences into the pcDNA3.1/myc-His(-)B vector (Invitrogen), the MSCV-IRES-YFP vector, or the MSCV-IRES-GFP vector, respectively. The entire coding region of CBFÎ² was subcloned into the pflag-CMV-4 expression vector. A reporter plasmid containing an M-CSF receptor (M-CSFR) promoter (pM-CSF-R-luc) was used to conduct the relevant experiments as described previously.17  Cell culture  Cells (293T and NIH 3T3) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Biochrom). The murine myeloid progenitor 32Dcl3 cell line (32D cells) was grown in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, L-glutamine, antibiotics, and 20 ng/mL of murine IL-3 (R&amp;amp;D Systems).  Subcellular localization  Cells (293T) were cultured in 6-well plates containing 12-mm round coverslips (104 cells/well). The full-length cDNAs of WT and RUNX1 mutants were cloned into expression vector pcDNA3.1. These constructs were transfected into the 293T cells using the calcium phosphate (Promega) transfection method. The expressed RUNX1 proteins were immunostained with anti-RUNX1 Ab (Cell Signaling Technology) and Rhodamine Red-X-AffiniPure goat antiâ€“rabbit IgG (H+L; Jackson ImmunoResearch), and the nucleus were stained with 4â€²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed on a confocal microscope. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were also analyzed by Western blot (WB).  ChIP-qPCR  ChIP was carried out using the ChIP Assay Kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s protocol with anti-RUNX1 Ab (Cell Signaling Technology). The immunoprecipitated chromatin from WT or mutated RUNX1 transduced 32D cells was detected in triplicate by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) using the indicated probes (supplemental Table 1, available on the Blood Web site; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article). The levels of enrichment of each promoter by the indicated RUNX1 proteins were analyzed according to the method recommended by the ChampionChIP qPCR Primers manufacturer (SABiosciences).  Gel-filtration study  Nuclear extracts from 293T cells cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding myc-RUNX1-WT and flag-RUNX1 mutants were analyzed by gel filtration using an Ã„KTAxpress MAb system with a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). Collected fractions were analyzed by WB analysis using anti-myc Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).  CoIP  For coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP), 10 Î¼g of different myc-RUNX1â€“expressing plasmids was cotransfected with 10 Î¼g of flag-CBFÎ²â€“expressing plasmid into 293T cells. Whole-cell lysate extracted with RIPA buffer (Beyotime) after 48 hours was immunoprecipitated by anti-flag M2 beads (Sigma-Aldrich) using a standard protocol. The Abs used for WB were anti-flag (M2) Ab (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-myc Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-CBFÎ² polyclonal Ab (Abcam).  Gel-shift assay  The gel-shift assay was performed using RUNX1 response element probe (5â€²-TCGACAAGATTTCCAAACTCTGTGGTTGCCTTG-3â€²) as described previously.19,20  Retroviral transduction and generation of stable cell lines  32D cells were infected by retroviral supernatants harboring WT RUNX1 or mutant in culture medium supplemented with polybrene (8 Î¼g/mL; Millipore). GFP+ cells were isolated by flow cytometry after 48 hours and sorted again after 2 weeks to generate stable cell lines expressing the GFP and RUNX1 proteins.  Differentiation assay, colony-forming assay, semiquantitative RT-PCR, and growth kinetics assay in 32D cells  The G-CSF (R&amp;amp;D Systems)â€“induced 32D cell differentiation experiments and colony-forming assay were carried out as described previously.21 For detection of murine myeloperoxidase (MPO), lactoferrin (LF), and Î²-actin, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described previously.22 To investigate the growth kinetics of 32D cells in the G-CSF treatment and after withdrawal of G-CSF, growth curves were generated by counting viable cells.  Retroviral preparations, BM transplantation, and hematopathologic analysis in mice  Retroviral supernatants were generated, and BM transplantation was performed as described previously.17 Hematopathologic analysis and flow cytometric immunophenotyping were performed as described previously.18 Cumulative probability of survival after BM transplantation was presented in a Kaplan-Meier format using Prism Version 5 software (GraphPad). To assess whether the primary leukemic cells were transplantable, 5 Ã— 105 cells were injected into the tail veins of sublethally irradiated (400 cGy) secondary recipient mice. All animal experiments were approved by the Department of Animal Experimentation at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.  Results  High frequency of RUNX1 mutations in CML patients with acute transformation  The RUNX1 gene was found to be mutated in 11 of 85 (12.9%) patients with CML acute transformation (28 AP and 57 BC) by sequencing both cDNA and genomic DNA of the whole RUNX1 gene (Figure 1A and Table 1) and eliminating single-nucleotide polymorphisms by screening 200 normal controls. No mutation was detected in these patients during CML-CP, indicating that the RUNX1 mutation is correlated with acute transformation of CML. All of the RUNX1 mutations were heterozygous, with the other allele still being WT in these 11 patients. In total, 10 types of mutations, 5 missense mutations (H78Q, W79C, R139G, D171G, and R174Q), 2 truncated mutations (L71fs-ter94 and V91fs-ter94) in the N-terminal region, 1 nonsense (R293X) and 2 elongation-frameshift mutations (Y260fs-ter573 and G381fs-ter570) in the C-terminal region were identified (Figure 1A). The most frequently detected mutations were located at RHD, including all 5 missense mutations and 2 truncated mutations. The 11 patients with RUNX1 mutations were all characterized by an acute myeloblastic transformation morphology (Figure 1B).

View inlineView popup Table 1 Main clinical and biological features of CML-AP/BC patients with RUNX1 mutations Subcellular localization of WT and mutated RUNX1  Previous studies have indicated that RHD (residues 50-177), nuclear localization signal (residues 167-183), and nuclear matrix targeting signal (residues 351-381) are important for the punctuate subnuclear distribution of the RUNX1 protein.12 To investigate the subcellular localization of the mutated RUNX1 (Figure 2A), we performed immunostaining experiments using anti-RUNX1 Ab. We found that some RUNX1 mutants, including D171G in RHD, R293X in TAD, and G381fs-ter570 in TRD, were evenly localized in the nucleus, similar to WT RUNX1; others, such as H78Q and R174Q in the RHD, presented nuclear speckle distribution; and still others, such as V91fs-ter94 and R139G, showed a weakened nuclear localization concomitant with an increased cytoplasmic distribution (Figure 2B). These results are consistent with a previous study showing that nuclear localization of the RUNX1 product critically depends on the integrity of the RHD.23 To further confirm the subcellular localization of WT and mutated RUNX1, we examined RUNX1 protein expression in cellular nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts, respectively. As shown in Figure 2C, the mutant proteins V91fs-ter94 and R139G were detected in both the nuclear and cytosolic fractions, whereas WT RUNX1 and the other mutants were exclusively detected in nuclear protein extracts.  Figure 2 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 2 Subcellular localization of the WT and mutated RUNX1 proteins. (A) Schematic representation of RUNX1 showing location of functional domains and specific RUNX1 mutations used in our study. Horizontal bars indicate RUNX1 (453 aa), including the RHD domain (50-177 aa), the ES domain (242-262 aa), the TAD domain (291-371 aa), and the TRD domain (371-411 aa). The numbers in the left column indicate the unique patient numbers (UPN2, UPN4-UPN8, UPN10, and UPN11) described in Table 1. Mutant no. in the right column indicates the number of mutants. (B) Subcellular localization of the indicated RUNX1 proteins was visualized by confocal microscopy analysis in the 293T cell line. Left panels show the merged images; middle panels, localization patterns of WT RUNX1 or mutants; and the right panels show nuclei as visualized by 4â€²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. (C) Expression patterns of RUNX1 mutant proteins in the 293T cell line. A total of 2 Ã— 106 cells for each mutant were used for stepwise separation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extraction, and extracted proteins from an equivalent of 4 Ã— 105 cells per fraction were used for WB. An Ab against RUNX1 was used to detect the exogenously expressed RUNX1 proteins. The 2 different gels are indicated by the gray dividing lines; n indicates nuclear protein extraction; and c, cytoplasmic protein extraction. Transregulatory activities of RUNX1 mutants  Because RUNX1 is a key TF in the regulation of normal hematopoiesis,24,25 we determined the transregulatory activities of its mutants using an M-CSFR promoterâ€“containing RUNX1 response elementâ€“coupled luciferase reporter. A previous study indicated that CBFÎ² alone could not induce the transactivation of the promoter of M-CSFR.26 In contrast, when WT RUNX1 and CBFÎ² were cotransfected into 293T cells, the activation potential was induced 10-fold higher compared with CBFÎ² alone. None of the mutants induced significant transactivation except G381fs-ter570 (supplemental Figure 1A). We also investigated whether RUNX1 mutants could act as dominant-negative inhibitors of WT RUNX1. Unlike WT RUNX1, which transactivated the M-CSFR promoter in a dose-dependent manner, RUNX1 mutants, including H78Q, V91fs-ter94, R139G, D171G, R174Q, and R293X, could affect the reporter activities and abrogate the dose-dependent increase of transactivation of WT RUNX1 when cotransfected with WT RUNX1 (Figure 3A and supplemental Figure 1B). Interestingly, the RUNX1-H78Q and V91fs-ter94 mutants even suppressed the basal transactivation activity of WT RUNX1 (Figure 3A). As expected, the G381fs-ter570 mutant induced the transactivation activity similarly to WT RUNX1.  Figure 3 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 3 Functional analysis of RUNX1 mutants in vitro. (A) Transcriptional potential of the RUNX1 mutants in 293T cells. Cells were cotransfected with 0.5 Î¼g of pM-CSF-R-luc reporter plasmid, 0.5 Î¼g of flag-CBFÎ² expression plasmid, the indicated amount of RUNX1 expression plasmid, and 0.05 Î¼g of pRL-SV40 as an internal control. The myc-WT RUNX1â€“encoding plasmid (0.5 Î¼g) was cotransfected with increasing doses (0.5, 1, and 1.5 Î¼g) of expression vectors containing the indicated RUNX1 mutants. Each value represents the mean of 3 independent experiments. The relative luciferase units are expressed as average Â± SD. (B) DNA-binding potential of RUNX1 mutants analyzed by gel-shift assay using nuclear extracts from 293T cells transfected with WT or mutated RUNX1 expression plasmids. (C) ChIP-qPCR assay of the IL-3, GM-CSF, M-CSFR, MPO, and TCRÎ² promoters in 32D cells. WT RUNX1 and G381fs-ter570 proteins, but not H78Q, V91fs-ter94, R139G, D171G, R174Q, or R293X mutant proteins, were enriched on these promoters. (D) Heterodimerization ability of RUNX1 mutants with CBFÎ². 293T cells were transfected transiently with flag-CBFÎ² together with myc-WT RUNX1 or mutants. Upper panel shows that the immunoprecipitation of whole-cell lysates by anti-flag Abs coprecipitates the indicated myc-RUNX1 proteins; bottom panel shows the corresponding CBFÎ² expression levels analyzed by anti-CBFÎ² Ab. The numbers (1-7) represent various RUNX1 mutants that are also shown in panel C and in Figure 2A. The 2 different gels are indicated by the gray dividing lines. (E) RUNX1 mutants compete with WT to bind CBFÎ². Ectopic expression of RUNX1 mutants could impair the interaction between WT RUNX1 and CBFÎ². 293T cells were transfected with flag-CBFÎ² and myc-tagged WT RUNX1 or with RUNX1 mutants. After 48 hours, the proteins were prepared for anti-flag immunoprecipitation, followed by WB with anti-flag and anti-myc Abs. H78Q, R139G, D171G, R174Q, and G381fs-ter570, especially R293X, but not V91fs-ter94, could compete with WT to bind CBFÎ². (F) Interaction between WT and mutated RUNX1 proteins. 293T cells were transiently transfected with flag-RUNX1 together with myc-WT RUNX1 or mutants. After 48 hours, whole-cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-flag Ab and analyzed by WB with anti-myc (top panel) and anti-flag (bottom panel) Abs. Flag-RUNX1 efficiently interacts with myc-WT RUNX1, H78Q, R139G, D171G, and R174Q, but not with V91fs-ter94, R293X, or G381fs-ter570. (G) Gel-filtration analysis. Protein fractions collected from the indicated elution volumes were analyzed by WB using anti-myc Ab. Vertical lines show the positions of the corresponding size standards. Abilities of RUNX1 mutants to bind DNA and heterodimerize with CBFÎ²  The RHD of RUNX1 is responsible for both DNA binding and heterodimerization with CBFÎ².19 To analyze the DNA-binding ability of RUNX1 mutants, an oligonucleotide probe containing the consensus RUNX1-binding sequence and nuclear extracts from 293T cells transfected with WT RUNX1 or mutants were used in gel-shift analysis.20 A DNA/protein complex was detectable using nuclear extracts from the transfectants expressing WT RUNX1, mutated RUNX1 R293X, or G381fs-ter570 (Figure 3B). However, the DNA/protein complex was undetectable for those RUNX1 mutants in the RHD, including H78Q, V91fs-ter94, R139G, D171G, and R174Q, indicating that these mutants had lost their DNA-binding potential.  Because RUNX1 mutants either lost transregulatory activity or could even suppress that of WT RUNX1, we examined their binding ability to target promoter using the ChIP-qPCR assay in the 32D cell line. Five consensus target genes of RUNX1, IL3, MPO, M-CSFR, GM-CSF, and TCRÎ², were analyzed.27â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“32 As shown in Figure 3C, WT RUNX1 could highly enrich the promoter region of these 5 candidate genes compared with mock. In contrast, RUNX1 H78Q, V91fs-ter94, R139G, D171G, and R174Q lost their ability to bind these target gene-promoter regions.  We performed CoIP assays to determine whether the RUNX1 mutants were still capable of interacting with CBFÎ². We found that the truncated RUNX1 mutant V91fs-ter94 lost heterodimerization ability with CBFÎ², whereas WT and the other mutants of RUNX1, including H78Q, R139G, D171G, R174Q, R293X, and G381fs-ter570, were coimmunoprecipitated with CBFÎ² (Figure 3D), suggesting that they could heterodimerize with CBFÎ² and therefore even compete with WT RUNX1 in heterodimer formation. Indeed, cotransfection of all RUNX1 mutants except V91fs-ter94 was able to reduce WT RUNX1/CBFÎ² heterodimerization (Figure 3E), with R293X showing the strongest effect.  Interference of RUNX1 oligomer formation by RUNX1 mutants  It has been reported previously that RUNX1 could homodimerize and that the dimerization altered by mutations could impair the ability of RUNX1 to regulate differentiation.33 We analyzed the interaction between WT and mutated RUNX1 proteins with a CoIP experiment and found that WT RUNX1 could efficiently interact with either WT RUNX1 or the H78Q, R139G, D171G, and R174Q mutants, but not with V91fs-ter94, R293X, or G381fs-ter570 (Figure 3F). It has been well established that TFs do not work as monomers and need to form a complex with various proteins for full activity and specificity.34â‡“â‡“â€“37 Given that oligomerization might be the mechanism responsible for oncogenic activation of PML-RARÎ± and RUNX1-ETO fusions,38,39 we investigated whether RUNX1 mutants could affect the capacity to form high-molecular-weight complexes of WT RUNX1. As shown in Figure 3G, 3 mutants (R139G, R174Q, and R293X) exerted no obvious disturbance on the high-molecular-weight complex formation of the WT RUNX1 protein, whereas under the effect of the V91fs-ter94, D171G, and G381fs-ter570 mutants, the peaks of complexes shifted to lower-molecular-weight fractions. Therefore, the latter 3 mutants might interfere with the oligomerization ability of WT RUNX1.  Blockage of granulocytic differentiation of 32D cells by RUNX1 mutants  Because the differentiation of myeloid lineage is impaired in AML-type CML-BC patients, we chose H78Q and V91fs-ter94 to examine at the cellular level the functional consequences of these 2 RUNX1 mutants on granulocytic differentiation programs. Control vector and constructs expressing WT RUNX1 or mutant proteins were stably transfected into 32D cells using retroviral techniques. Four independent cell lines were generated: control vector, WT RUNX1, H78Q, and V91fs-ter94. WB analysis showed that the exogenous proteins were expressed correctly (Figure 4A). The 32D cells could be induced to differentiate into granulocytes by G-CSF, thus providing a model system with which to study the effects of RUNX1 mutations on myeloid lineage.21 G-CSFâ€“mediated differentiation of 32D cells transduced with the empty vector, WT RUNX1, or mutated RUNX1 expression vector was reflected by morphological appearance, the expression of surface marker Gr-1 (granulocyte), and expression of specific genes such as MPO (primary granule) and LF (secondary granule).  Figure 4 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 4 Myeloid progenitorâ€“expressing RUNX1 mutants fail to differentiate into granulocytes. (A) Expression of exogenous RUNX1 proteins was detected by WB using RUNX1 polyclonal Ab in 32D cells. (B) Differentiation induction by G-CSF in all 4 indicated stable cell lines. Wright staining of 32D cell lines at day 0 or day 8 of G-CSF treatment. (C) The percentage of 32D cells in 3 different stages of myeloid differentiation is indicated (day 8). (D) The expression profile of MPO and LF mRNA was examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR in the 4 indicated 32D cell lines with G-CSF treatment for 0, 3, 6, 8, and 10 days. (E) Expression pattern of Gr-1 reveals maturational arrest of 32D cells with RUNX1 mutants. The expression profiles of Gr-1 of 32D cell lines at day 0 or day 8 of G-CSF treatment are shown. (F) Growth properties of 32D stable cell lines. Left, all 4 cell lines were grown in the indicated conditions, and cells were counted each day. The 32D cell lines expressing the mutated RUNX1 protein continue to proliferate when cultured in the presence of G-CSF, whereas the cell lines transfected with vector and WT RUNX1 construct stopped proliferation 5 days after G-CSF treatment. Error bars represent SD. Right, growth curve of the 14 days after withdrawal of G-CSF. Cells expressing either of the 2 mutants kept growing after replacing G-CSF with IL-3, whereas growth of cells with control vector or WT decreased rapidly. Error bars represent SD. (G) Quantification of the colonies for 32D stable cell lines in methylcellulose. 32D cell lines at day 0 or day 8 of G-CSF treatment were plated in methylcellulose medium containing IL-3. Colonies were counted after incubation at 37Â°C for 14 days. For control vector and WT RUNX1, the cells underwent gross morphological changes of maturation to granulocytes after the replacement of IL-3 with G-CSF (25 ng/mL) for 8 days, and gradually lost viability for the next 2 days (Figure 4B,F). In contrast, 32D cells with expression of H78Q or V91fs-ter94 were blocked at the promyelocytic stage of differentiation under G-CSF treatment (Figure 4B). These results were quantified by scoring for blast cells as immature myeloid progenitors, metamyelocytes/band cells as early stages of myeloid differentiation, and segmented cells as mature granulocytes. A significantly higher percentage of the blast cells was detected in 32D cells with H78Q (average, 82%) and V91fs-ter94 (average, 71%) compared with those transfected with control vector (average, 14%) or WT RUNX1 (average, 27%; Figure 4C). The expression profiles of MPO and LF mRNAs were different in 32D cells expressing H78Q or V91fs-ter94 compared with those with control vector or WT RUNX1 during the 10 days of culture in the presence of G-CSF. For H78Q and V91fs-ter94, MPO expression increased and reached a peak at day 8, but then stayed at that level at day 10, whereas LF expression did not change significantly (Figure 4D). To further determine the precise stage of differentiation block, Gr-1, a surface Ag marker for the later stages of myeloid differentiation, was used to assess the maturational status of the transduced cells by flow cytometry.21 Gr-1 expression was inhibited significantly in cells with RUNX1 H78Q (13.3% Â± 4.6%, average Â± SD) or V91fs-ter94 (22.7% Â± 4.2%, average Â± SD) compared with control vector (43.7% Â± 9.7%, average Â± SD) and WT (38.7% Â± 9.1%, average Â± SD) after 8 days of treatment with G-CSF (Figure 4E). These results suggested that the RUNX1 mutants H78Q and V91fs-ter94 could block granulocytic differentiation at an early stage. Of note, although 32D cells with control vector and WT gradually lost growth ability in the presence of G-CSF, those with mutations continuously grew. Cells expressing either of the 2 mutants kept growing after replacing G-CSF with IL-3, whereas the growth of cells with control vector or WT decreased rapidly (Figure 4F).  To explore the transforming abilities of the RUNX1 mutations, we next examined the colony-forming ability of the 32D cell lines in methylcellulose. All 4 cell lines isolated at day 0 exhibited similar colony-forming ability, whereas at day 8 after treatment with G-CSF, cells expressing RUNX1 H78Q or V91fs-ter94 formed significantly more colonies than those with either control vector or WT RUNX1 (Figure 4G). The enhanced transforming potential in the mutant cell lines was in agreement with the increased number of immature cells (Figure 4B-E).  Cooperation between RUNX1 mutants and BCR-ABL to induce an AML-like phenotype  To explore the role of RUNX1 mutations in the progression of CML, we examined the leukemogenic potential of RUNX1 mutants with or without BCR-ABL using a murine BM transduction and transplantation system. MSCV-based retroviral constructs carrying BCR-ABL upstream of an IRES-GFP cassette or RUNX1 mutant upstream of an IRES-YFP cassette were generated and used for cotransduction. The protein expression levels of these constructs were detected in NIH 3T3 cells after cotransduction with retroviral plasmids (supplemental Figure 2). Hematopoietic cells were tracked for in vivo expression of BCR-ABL (GFP+), RUNX1 mutant (YFP+), or both BCR-ABL and RUNX1 mutant (GFP+/YFP+). 5-Fluoruracilâ€“treated BM cells were transduced with RUNX1 mutants H78Q or V91fs-ter94 and BCR-ABL and then transplanted into lethally irradiated syngeneic recipient mice.  BCR-ABL induced a lethal CML-like disease characterized by massive expansion of myeloid cells and infiltration of BM, spleen, and liver, as evidenced by hepatosplenomegaly. The immunophenotype of leukemia cells showed features of granulocytic maturation with increased GFP+/Mac-1+/Gr-1+ cells (Figure 5D, Table 2, and supplemental Table 2) in mice at 17-25 days after BM transplantation (Figure 5E). However, RUNX1 H78Q or V91fs-ter94 alone did not cause obvious hematopoietic disease in mice during an observation period of 120 days.

View inlineView popup Table 2 Quantitation of BM cells at different stages of maturation Interestingly, coexpression of BCR-ABL and RUNX1 H78Q caused a CML-BCâ€“like disease, whereas coexpression of RUNX1 V91fs-ter94 and BCR-ABL led to a CML-APâ€“like phenotype, with a median latency of 39 days and 24 days after transplantation, respectively (Figure 5E and Table 2). Expression of BCR-ABL and RUNX1 mutants was detected in leukemic mice by WB analysis (Figure 5A). Eight of 10 (80%) mice transduced with BCR-ABL plus RUNX1 H78Q and 3 of 9 (33.3%) mice transduced with BCR-ABL plus RUNX1 V91fs-ter94 developed a fatal CML-BCâ€“like or CML-APâ€“like disease (Table 2), respectively. High numbers (average, 22.6%) of immature cells (myeloblasts + promyelocytes) were present in the BM of leukemic mice with BCR-ABL and RUNX1 H78Q (Figure 5B and Table 2). In contrast to the predominance of mature granulocytic cells in BCR-ABL mice, the fraction of immature cells was also increased in BCR-ABL plus RUNX1 V91fs-ter94 mice, albeit to a lesser extent (average, 9.3%). Flow cytometric analysis of cells from the BM of mice with CML-BCâ€“like or CML-APâ€“like disease showed that the GFP/YFPâ€“coexpressing cells contained more immature blasts (CD117+, Mac-1âˆ’, Gr-1âˆ’, and B220âˆ’) compared with BCR-ABL mice (Figure 5C-D and supplemental Table 2). These results strongly suggest that RUNX1 H78Q and V91fs-ter94 may impair granulocytic differentiation of BCR-ABLâ€“harboring hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.  The longer disease latency of the BCR-ABL plus RUNX1 H78Q mice compared with the BCR-ABL alone group might have been because of the fact that more immature leukemic cells tend to be retained in the hematopoietic tissues instead of being released to the circulation and causing thrombosis in capillaries of organs such as the lung. In contrast, BCR-ABL mice develop a much severe hyperleukocytosis (supplemental Table 3), leading to massive infiltration of mature granulocytes in the lungs and subsequent pulmonary hemorrhages, which may be the most likely cause of the rapid death of these mice. A similar phenomenon was observed in previous study&#x27;s finding that mice expressing both BCR-ABL and RUNX1/MDS1/EVI1 exhibited longer disease latency compared with BCR-ABL mice.7  To determine the self-renewal properties and leukemia-initiating potential of the leukemic cells derived from BCR-ABL plus RUNX1-H78Q or RUNX1-V91fs-ter94, we used sublethally irradiated mice as recipients for secondary transplantation experiments. Indeed, mice with BCR-ABL alone exhibited not only less severe hyperleukocytosis than those in the first transplantation (P &amp;lt; .05), but also much longer survival timesâ€”although they all ultimately died of CML-like disease (Figure 5F, supplemental Figure 3, and supplemental Table 3). Conversely, mice bearing both BCR-ABL and RUNX1 mutants displayed hematopoietic disease with phenotypes similar to the primary leukemia but with much more aggressive disease, as evidenced by much shorter survival times.  Discussion  CML provides us with a unique model for studying multistep leukemogenesis, in that it allows a dissection of accumulating and interactive molecular abnormalities involving driver genes and pathways at distinct stages of the disease. In the model used in the present study, the constitutively active tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL generated by the Ph chromosome represents the basic driver of the leukemogenesis at CP, but progression to BC required additional genetic or molecular mutations. The mechanisms responsible for transition of CP into BC are still poorly understood, although some evidence suggests that the phenotype of CML-BC cells characterized by enhanced proliferation, survival advantage, and differentiation arrest depends on cooperation of BCR-ABL with genes dysregulated or with aberrant structure/function during disease progression.  Abnormalities affecting TFs or epigenetic regulators and genes involved in signal transduction represent the most frequently detected genetic events in human acute leukemia. Evidence from animal studies also suggests that genetic alterations of essential signaling molecules such as tyrosine kinases usually lead to a CML-like phenotype and disruption of TFs mainly causes MDS, whereas both events may be required to induce a full-blown acute leukemia. Previous studies have shown that the AML-related fusion TFs NUP98/HOXA9 and RUNX1/MDS1/EVI1 could cooperate with BCR-ABL to induce CML-BC in mouse models.8,40 To test the hypothesis that the involvement of TFs should be critical in CML-BC, we screened several such candidates. Abnormalities of several TF genes such as GATA-2 and RUNX1 have been identified as being related to CML progression for hematopoiesis.17 CML-AP/BC patients with GATA-2 mutations tend to exhibit an acute myelomonocytic leukemia phenotype, whereas patients with RUNX1 mutations have features of acute myeloblastic leukemia in CML-AP/BC. The fact that the RUNX1 mutation was detected in a sizable proportion of CML-AP/BC cases (12.9%), but not among patients during CML-CP (a situation reminiscent of GATA-2 mutations17), indicates strongly that these mutations are specifically acquired or selected from a very small subset of the leukemia cell population at CP during CML acute transformation.  Ten types of RUNX1 mutations were identified in our CML-AP/BC patients, and most were located at RHD (7 of 10). It is well known that RHD is the key domain of RUNX1 for transregulatory activity and mediates both DNA binding and heterodimerization with CBFÎ².19 We compared the functional consequences of different RUNX1 mutations located at 3 main structural domains, including H78Q, R139G, D171G, R174Q, and V91fs-ter94 in RHD; R293X in TAD; and G381fs-ter570 in TRD. In general, missense, nonsense, and frameshift RUNX1 mutants displayed reduced transactivation activity and/or a dominant-negative function on the WT RUNX1 (Table 3). Consistent with the position of the mutations in the RHD including H78Q, R139G, D171G, and R174Q, DNA binding of these mutant proteins was absent or significantly decreased. These mutants were also capable of inhibiting the transactivation of a reporter gene by WT RUNX1, but retained the ability to heterodimerize with CBFÎ². However, the truncated RUNX1 mutant V91fs-ter94, located at the RHD, lost its heterodimerization ability with CBFÎ², possibly because of the absence of almost the entire RHD. R293X, another truncated RUNX1 mutant with an intact RHD but deletion of both TAD and TRD, retained its DNA-binding ability and inhibited transactivation, but also led to a more efficient heterodimerization, probably because of the deletion of TRD. RUNX1-related fusion proteins such RUNX1-ETO have been shown to form complexes with CBFÎ² and other nuclear proteins more efficiently than WT RUNX1.41 Consistent with a previous study,42 our present data suggest that deletion of a negative-regulatory-domain TRD for heterodimerization in the C-terminal region of RUNX1 results in more efficient heterodimer formation.  View inlineView popup Table 3 Biological functions of RUNX1 mutants assayed in this study RUNX1 homodimerizes through a mechanism involving a C terminus to C terminus interaction (aa 372-411).33 Our data showed that R293X and G381fs-ter570, with truncated TRD and elongated peptide, exhibited no ability for homodimerization. However, the G381fs-ter570 mutant behaved abnormally while forming a complex with WT RUNX1, probably because of the partial deletion of TRD or the effect of the abnormally elongated peptide. It is interesting that V91fs-ter94, though losing its ability to interact with CBFÎ² or DNA, could still exert an inhibitory effect on the transactivation activity of WT RUNX1. One of the reasons for this could be that RUNX1 V91fs-ter94 affects the formation of RUNX1 oligomers. Indeed, the disruption of high-molecular-weight complexes by this truncation mutant was observed, which might disturb the transcription regulation and may explain the inhibitory effect seen in the luciferase reporter assay. Seven truncated RUNX1 mutations with complete or partial deletion of the RHD in 470 adult patients with de novo AML were identified previously by Tang et al,13 so the truncated RUNX1 mutations are recurrent events. However, whether the truncated proteins are indeed expressed in patient cells needs further study, because stop codon mutations at the genomic level occurring in upstream exons often result in unstable mRNA prone to degradation (although the V91fs-ter94 protein was detectable in both transduced cell lines and mouse models in the present study).  Previous studies have shown that RUNX1 mutations exhibit a dominant-negative function in AML,43 suggesting that this effect is also crucial for the pathogenesis of other RUNX1-related leukemias. According to our biochemistry and functional analysis data, we hypothesize that RUNX1 mutations might exhibit a dominant-negative function through 2 different molecular mechanisms. First, mutated RUNX1 might competitively inhibit the binding either between WT RUNX1 and DNA or WT RUNX1 and CBFÎ² in heterodimerization or between WT RUNX1 proteins for homodimerization. Second, mutated RUNX1 might affect the capacity of WT RUNX1 to form high-molecular-weight complexes.  It has been reported by others that the RUNX1 D171N mutation may have leukemogenic potential in myeloproliferative neoplasms,44 and was also shown to induce MDS or MDS/AML in a mouse BM transplantation model.45 Mouse experiments from Enver et al showed that expression of the full-length isoform RUNX1b abrogated engraftment potential of murine long-term reconstituting stem cells in a mouse BM transplantation model.46 Interestingly, all of our CML-AP/BC patients with mutated RUNX1 displayed differentiation arrest at the myeloblast stage. Consistent with the myeloblastic features of CML-AP/BC patients with RUNX1 mutations, H78Q and V91fs-ter94 disturbed the G-CSFâ€“induced myeloid differentiation of 32D cells. In vivo studies showed that RUNX1 H78Q or V91fs-ter94 cooperates with BCR-ABL in the induction of CML-BC/APâ€“like disease in mice, suggesting that RUNX1 mutations play a critical role in the pathogenesis of acute transformation of CML. Our data also show that different RUNX1 mutations have distinct transforming potentials, because 80% of mice with RUNX1 H78Q and BCR-ABL developed a CML-BCâ€“like disease, whereas 33.3% of mice with RUNX1 V91fs-ter94 and BCR-ABL developed a CML-APâ€“like disease. These results seem to agree with our biochemistry data showing a higher dominant-negative effect of H78Q than V91fs-ter94 on the transregulatory activities of WT RUNX1.  In conclusion, we screened a relatively large cohort of Chinese CML-BC or CML-AP patients for genetic abnormalities and conducted a spectrum of biochemical experiments to characterize the function of the various RUNX1 mutants. In this study, we have developed a useful mouse model for further exploration of the mechanisms by which RUNX1 mutations contribute to CML acute transformation, and have shown that RUNX1 is a key molecule in acute transition in CML. The present mouse model will shed light on our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying acute transformation of CML, and may lead to a better therapeutic outcome for patients with this difficult leukemia.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;Introduction  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal stem-cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and susceptibility to leukemic transformation (MDS/acute myelogenous leukemia [AML]). Progression from MDS-refractory anemia with excess blasts (MDS-RAEB) to AML is frequently observed in the clinical course, which is thought to result from serial acquisition of cytogenetic abnormalities.1â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“5 According to the 2-hit model of leukemogenesis, one class of mutations (class I), including FLT3-ITD, N-Ras, or K-Ras mutations, confers on cells a proliferative advantage; a second class of mutations (class II), including AML1/ETO, PML/RARÎ±, or MLL-related fusion genes, interferes with hematopoietic differentiation.6 Indeed, it has been reported that a combination of class I and II mutations such as FLT3-ITD plus AML1-ETO or MLL-SEPT6 induced AML in a mouse bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model, while either class I or II mutations alone led to, if anything, myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), not leukemia.6â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“13 On the other hand, the precise molecular mechanism underlying development of MDS and MDS/AML remains elusive partly because there are only a few mouse models for MDS and MDS/AML available. So far, 2 distinct models of MDS have been reported: Evi1 induced MDS-like symptoms in a mouse BMT model in which the mice succumbed to fatal peripheral cytopenia,14 while NUP98-HOXD13 transgenic mice developed MDS and died of either various types of acute leukemia or severe anemia and leukocytopenia.15 In the present study, we generated a mouse BMT model of MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML induced by AML1 mutants frequently found in patients with MDS and MDS/AML. Interestingly, the phenotypes of these mice very much resemble those of the human diseases.  The AML1 gene is located on chromosome 21q22 and is the most frequent target for chromosomal translocation in leukemia. Analysis of AML1-deficient mice has shown that AML1 is indispensable for the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis.16â‡“â€“18 As accumulated studies have demonstrated, heterozygous germline mutations in the AML1 gene caused familial platelet disorder with predisposition to AML (FPD/AML),19,20 and sporadic point mutations were frequently found in the development of leukemia: 21% of AML M0, 15.0% to 15.9% of MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML, and 46% of radiation-associated MDS.21â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“29 The vast majority of AML1 mutations were located in the Runt homology domain (RHD), which mediated its ability to bind to DNA and core-binding factor Î² (CBFÎ²). To confirm the involvement of AML1 mutations in hematopoietic disorders, we selected 2 types of AML1 mutants found in patients with MDS/AML: one with a point mutation in RHD (AML1-D171N), and the other with C-terminal truncation caused by a frame-shift (AML1-S291fsX300). After transplantation using bone marrow cells infected with retrovirus vectors harboring AML1 mutants, most of the mice that received transplants died of MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML. Long-term analysis demonstrated that the phenotype of the mice that underwent transplantation depended on the kind of AML1 mutants used in this study and on the integration sites of retroviruses. Considering the recent reports of the effects of retrovirus integration sites on biological results,30â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“38 identification of integration sites may lead to the discovery of the genes involved in the induction of MDS/AML in concert with AML1 mutants. Intriguingly, the enhanced expression of Evi1 by retrovirus integration seemed to collaborate with AML1-D171N to induce MDS/AML with the same phenotype. Moreover, we confirmed that combination of AML1-D171N and Evi1 induced AML of the same phenotype with shorter latencies in the mouse BMT model. This model will allow valuable insight into the molecular pathogenesis of MDS and MDS/AML.  Methods  Vector construction  We used 2 AML1 mutants, D171N or S291fsX300, identified from case no. 5 or 27, respectively, among patients with MDS/AML.25,26 These mutants are hereafter referred to as AML1-D171N and AML1-S291fs. AML1 wild-type (WT; AML1b), AML1-D171N, or AML1-S291fs, which was fused with a FLAG epitope tag at the N-terminus, was inserted upstream of the IRES-EGFP cassette of pMYs-IG to generate pMYs-AML1 WT, D171N, or S291fs-IG, respectively. pMYs-mouse Evi1-IG were kindly provided by Dr T. Nakamura (The Cancer Institute, Tokyo, Japan).38  Transfection and retrovirus production  Plat-E39 packaging cells maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) were transfected with retroviral constructs by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations. The medium was changed 1 day after the transfection, and retroviruses were harvested 48 hours after the transfection as previously described.39,40 Titers of the retroviruses were assessed based on the number of neomycin-resistant colonies of the infected NIH3T3 cells (average: 107 infection U/mL) as described.39  Mouse BMT  Bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated from the femurs and tibias of C57BL/6 (Ly-5.1) donor mice (9-12 weeks of age) 4 days after intraperitoneal administration of 150 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cultured overnight in Î± minimal essential medium (Î±MEM) supplemented with 20% FCS and 50 ng/mL of mouse stem cell factor (SCF), mouse FLT3 ligand (FL), human IL-6, and human thrombopoietin (TPO; R&amp;amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The prestimulated cells were infected for 60 hours with the retroviruses harboring pMYs-AML1 WT, D171N, or S291fs-IG, or an empty vector as a control, using 6-well dishes coated with RetroNectin (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations. Then, 0.2 to 3.5 Ã— 106 of infected bone marrow cells (Ly-5.1) were injected through tail vein into C57BL/6 (Ly-5.2)â€“recipient mice (8-12 weeks of age) which had been administered a sublethal dose of 5.25 Gy or a lethal dose of 9.5 Gy total-body Î³-irradiation (135Cs). For the lethally irradiated mice, a radioprotective dose of 2 Ã— 105 of bone marrow cells (Ly-5.2) was simultaneously injected. Probabilities of overall survival of the mice that received transplants were estimated using the Kaplan-Meiermethod. All animal studies were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo.  Analysis of the mice that underwent transplantation  Engraftment of bone marrow cells infected with retroviruses was confirmed by measuring the percentage of GFP+ and Ly-5.1+ cells in peripheral blood obtained every 1 to 2 months after the transplantation.  After the morbid mice were killed, their tissue samples, including peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), spleen, liver, and kidney, were analyzed. Circulating blood cells were counted by an analyzer. Morphology of the peripheral blood was evaluated by staining of air-dried smears with Hemacolor (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E). Cytospin preparations of bone marrow and spleen cells were also stained with Hemacolor. Percentage of blasts, myelocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and erythroblasts was estimated by examination of at least 200 cells. To assess whether the leukemic cells were transplantable, 2 Ã— 105 to 106 total BM cells including blasts were injected into the tail veins of sublethally irradiated mice. A total of 2 or 3 recipient mice were used for each serial transplantation.  Flow cytometric analysis  Red blood cells were lysed by using Ammonium Chloride Lysing Reagent (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) in PB or single-cell suspensions of bone marrow and spleen. Washed cells were incubated for 15 minutes at 4Â°C with 2.4G2 antibody for blocking and then stained for 20 minutes at 4Â°C with the following monoclonal phycoerythrin (PE)â€“conjugated antibodies: Ly-5.1, Gr-1, CD11b, B220, CD3, CD41, c-Kit, Sca-1, CD34, and Ter119. Flow cytometric analysis of the stained cells was performed with FACSCalibur flow (BD Biosciences) equipped with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences) and Flowjo software (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA).  Diagnosis  Diagnosis was made according to the Bethesda proposals for classification of nonlymphoid hematopoietic neoplasms in mice.41  Real-time RT-PCR  Total RNA was extracted from BM cells using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA was prepared with the Superscript II RT kit (Invitrogen). Real-time reverse transcriptionâ€“polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using a LightCycler Workflow System (Roche Diagnostics). cDNA was amplified using a SYBR Premix EX Taq (TAKARA). Reaction was subject to one cycle of 95Â°C for 30 seconds, 45 cycles of PCR at 95Â°C for 5 seconds, 55Â°C for 10 seconds, and 72Â°C for 10 seconds. All samples were independently analyzed at least 3 times. The following primer pairs were used: 5â€²-CCAGATGTCACATGACAGTGGAAAGCACTA-3â€² (forward) and 5â€²-CCGGGTTGGCATGACTCATATTAACCATGG-3â€² (reverse) for Evi1; 5â€²-TACCTCAACCCCTGACAGCTATGG-3â€² (forward) and 5â€²-TCGGTTGGAGATATCAGAGTGCAG-3â€² (reverse) for MN1;42 and 5â€²-GTTATCCCATCTGCATCAGCATCTGG-3â€² (forward) and 5â€²-GGTCCTCTTCACTCTTCATGAACAGC-3â€² (reverse) for MDS1/Evi1.43 Relative gene expression levels were calculated using standard curves generated by serial dilutions of cDNA. Product quality was checked by melting curve analysis via LightCycler software (Roche Diagnostics). Expression levels were normalized by a control, the expression level of GAPDH mRNA.  Western blot analysis  To detect the expression of AML1 WT, mutants, or Evi1, equal numbers of spleen cells were lysed, and Western blotting was performed as described with minor modifications.13 Polyclonal rabbit anti-Evi1 antibody (a kind gift from Dr M. Kurokawa, Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan), or a monoclonal mouse anti-Flag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was used for Evi1 or AML1, respectively.  Southern blot analysis  Genomic DNA was extracted from BM or spleen cells. After enzymatic digestion of 10 Î¼g DNA with EcoRI followed by electrophoretic separation, proviruses were probed with a GFP probe.  Bubble PCR  A total of 10 Î¼g of genomic DNA extracted from BM or spleen cells was digested with EcoRI, and the fragments were ligated overnight at 16Â°C to a double-stranded bubble linker (5â€²-AATTGAAGGAGAGGACGCTGTCTG-TCGAAGGTAAGGAACGGACGAGAGAAGGGAGAG-3â€² and 5â€²-GACTC-TCCCTTCTCGAATCGTAACCGTTCGTACGAGAATCGCTGTCCTCTCC-TTC-3â€²).44 Next, PCR was performed on the ligation product using a linker-specific Vectorette primer (5â€²-CGAATCGTAACCGTTCGTACGAGAATCGCT-3â€²)44,45 and a long-terminal repeat (LTR)â€“specific primer (5â€²-CGAGCTCAATAAAAGAGCCCACAACCCC-3â€²) under the following conditions: one cycle of 95Â°C for 5 minutes, 10 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 seconds, and 67Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 3 minutes, 10 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 seconds, and 67Â°C (this annealing temperature was reduced by 1Â°C each cycle) for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 3 minutes, 15 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 seconds and 57Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 3 minutes, and one cycle of 72Â°C for 90 seconds. Next, nested PCR was performed on 2 Î¼L of PCR products using a linker-specific Vectorette primer and an LTR-specific primer (5â€²-ATAAAAGAGCCCACAACCCCTCACTCGG-3â€²) under the following conditions: 1 cycle of 95Â°C for 5 minutes, 35 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 seconds and 60Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 3 minutes, and 1 cycle of 72Â°C for 90 seconds. The PCR product was electrophoresed using 1.0% agarose gel. Individual bands were excised and purified using PCR clear (Promega, Madison, WI) and were sequenced to identify the integration site of retrovirus. We confirmed inverse repeat sequence â€œGGGGGTCTTTCAâ€� as a marker of junction between genomic DNA and retrovirus sequence.  Results  The ratio of AML1 mutant-transduced cells gradually increased over several months after transplantation  To examine the effect of AML1 mutants on the hematopoietic abnormality, we chose 2 distinct mutants, AML1-D171N and AML1-S291fsX300, which are found in patients with MDS/AML.25,26 The former has a point mutation in RHD, and the latter possesses a frameshift mutation in the C-terminal region, resulting in truncation of the authentic protein (Figure 1A). Ly-5.1 murine BM cells infected with retroviruses harboring AML1 WT, AML1-D171N, AML1-S291fsX300, or empty vector were transplanted into irradiated syngeneic Ly-5.2 mice. In most of mice that received transplants of AML1-D171Nâ€“ or S291fsX300-transduced cells (hereafter referred to as mice/D171N or mice/S291fs, respectively), the ratio of GFP+ and Ly-5.1+ cells gradually increased over several months after the transplantation (Figure 1B), but not in mice that received transplants of AML1 WT-transduced cells or control retrovirus-infected cells (hereafter referred to as mice/WT or mice/mock, respectively). Gradual increase of c-kit+ cells in the PB was also observed in the mice that received transplants of AML1 mutant-transduced cells during the observation period (Figure 1C). Cells positive for c-kit and GFPâ€”that is, c-kit+ cells transduced with AML1 mutantsâ€”were morphologically blasts with high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratios (data not shown). In fact, the percentage of blasts gradually increased in the PB of the mice that received transplants of AML1 mutant-transduced cells, especially the mice/D171N. Finally, most of mice/D171N or mice/S291fs became sick and died with latencies of 4 to 13 months after the transplantation, while mice/mock were healthy over the observation period (Figure 1D). Overall survival of mice/D171N was not significantly different from that of mice/S291fs (P = .218). Expression of the transduced AML1-D171N or AML1-S291fs in spleen cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Figure 2A). Two of the mice/WT died during the observation period. BM of the 2 mice was occupied with GFP/Ly5.1 double-negative cells. One of the mice/WT developed leukemia derived from recipient cells at 272 days after transplantation. The remaining one mouse/WT died of anemia with unknown reason at 355 days after transplantation.

As a positive control, Plat-E packaging cells were transduced with mock (lane 1), AML1 WT (lane 2), AML1-D171N (lane 3), or AML1-S291fs (lane 4). Spleen cells were derived from mice/D171N (lanes 5-8), mice/S291fs (lanes 9-11), mice/WT (lane 12), mice/mock (lane 13), or control normal mouse (lane 14). White arrows indicate transduced AML1 WT, AML1-D171N, and AML1-S291fs. (B) AML1 WT-transduced cells were undetectable in PB at 1 month after the transplantation. Flow cytometric analysis of PB obtained from mice that received transplants of AML1-D171N, AML1-S291fs, AML1 WT, and mock at 1 month after transplantation. Interestingly, in the peripheral blood of mice/WT, GFP+ cell counts were extremely low 1 month after transplantation and thereafter became undetectable, despite the fact that 14% to 27% of the BM cells were positive for GFP before transplantation (Figures 1B,2B; Table S1, available on the Blood website; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article). Consistently, the expression of transduced AML1 WT was not detected in spleen cells of mice/WT (Figure 2A; mouse ID: 105). These data suggested that forced expression of AML1 WT in the stem cells had a negative effect on the survival and expansion of these cells in the BM. Recently, Tsuzuki et al reported that expression of the full-length isoform AML1b abrogated engraftment potential of murine long-term reconstituting stem cells in a mouse BMT model.46 Their result coincides with our result.  AML1-D171N and AML1-S291fs induced different diseases in mice that underwent transplantation  PB cell counts were different between mice/D171N and mice/S291fs; most mice/D171N (Figure 3A; lanes 1,2) showed leukocytosis, while mice/S291fs (Figure 3A; lane 3) showed leukocytopenia. This difference was significant (P = .007). Macroscopic observation of morbid mice revealed that severe hepatosplenomegaly was exclusively found in mice/D171N, but not in mice/S291fs (Figure 3E,F; Table S2).

Statistical differences were determined by 2-sample t test with Welch correction (*P &amp;lt; .05; **P &amp;lt; .01). Lane 1: mice/D171N without high expression of Evi1 in BM or not examined due to the lack of bone marrow samples (WBC, PLT, Hg, and MCV: n = 11; spleen: n = 5; and liver: n = 4). Lane 2: mice/D171N with high expression of Evi1 (n = 11). Lane 3: mice/S291fs (WBC, PLT, Hg, and MCV: n = 9; spleen and liver: n = 8). Lane 4: mice/WT (WBC, PLT, Hg, and MCV: n = 10; spleen and liver: n = 4). Lane 5: mice/mock (WBC, PLT, Hg, and MCV: n = 12; spleen: n = 6; and liver: n = 5). The smear specimens of peripheral blood were obtained every 1 to 2 months. The specimens showed that most of mice/D171N and mice/S291fs suffered from multilineage dysplasia characteristic of MDS. Erythroid dysplasia such as Howell-Jolly bodies, red cell polychromasia, and poikilocytosis (Figure 4A) were frequently detected in both mice. In BM specimens of morbid mice, orthochromatic giant erythroblasts and karyorrhexis were detected (Figure 4B). Erythroid dysplasia was more evident in mice/S291fs than in mice/D171N. As recently described in a mouse MDS model,15 increase of red blood cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was also observed in most mice/D171N and mice/S291fs (Figure 3D; Table S2). Myeloid dysplasia such as the pseudoâ€“Pelger-Huet anomaly (Figure 4C) was frequently detected in mice/D171N. Hypersegmented neutrophils (Figure 4D) and giant platelets (Figure 4F) were observed in 2 mice/D171N (mouse IDs 9 and 17). Collectively, AML1 mutants used in this study induced multilineage dysplasia, in particular in erythroid and myeloid lineages. Continuous pancytopenia was observed in 7 of 8 morbid mice/S291fs and 2 of 16 morbid mice/D171N, although BM of the morbid mice was not hypocellular but hypercellular or normocellular. Based on these findings, a final diagnosis was made by the ratio of blasts in the bone marrow according to the Bethesda proposals for classification of nonlymphoid hematopoietic neoplasms in mice.41 As a result, MDS/AML was recognized in 13 of 16 morbid mice/D171N and in 5 of 8 morbid mice/S291fs, while MDS-RAEB was recognized in 2 of 16 morbid mice/D171N and 2 of 8 morbid mice/S291fs (Table S2). One mouse/D171N was diagnosed with AML at 4 months after transplantation because we did not examine to see if the MDS phase had preceded AML (mouse ID 5). The leukemic cells derived from either mice/D171N or mice/S291fs were serially transplantable. We confirmed the serial transplantability in 11 mice/D171N (mouse IDs 4, 6, 9, 12-15, 17, 20, 22, and 26) and 6 mice/S291fs (mouse IDs 52, 54-56, 58, and 60). Penetrance of serial transplantation was 100%, except for mouse IDs 9 and 17; that is, 33% and 50%, respectively. Mice that underwent serial transplantation showed more aggressive status than primary mice and died with shorter latencies. Hematologic parameters of mice that underwent serial transplantation are shown in Table S3.

In summary, the pattern and degree of multilineage dysplasia differed among the mice that underwent transplantation. Although both mice/D171N and mice/S291fs died of MDS and MDS/AML within 4 to 13 months after transplantation, a marked difference existed in terms of clinical symptoms, including hematopoietic or macroscopic findings.  A distinct type of disease was identified in mice/D171N  Among the mice that underwent transplantation transduced with AML1-D171N, a distinct group was identified. GFP+ BM cells in 11 of 16 morbid mice/D171N (mouse IDs 4, 6, 7, 12-15, 19, 20, 22, and 26) displayed a similar phenotype, with high percentages of CD11b+ and B220+ cells (Figure 5; data not shown). All these mice/D171N showed dysplasia in myeloid and erythroid lineages for several months and died of MDS/AML with increased number of blasts, anemia, and, in some cases, thrombocytopenia (Table S2). These mice/D171N also showed severe hepatosplenomegaly (Figures 3E,F, 6A; Table S2), and histologic examination showed expansion of blasts and immature myeloid cells in the PB, BM, and spleen, and the invasion of these cells into hepatic portal areas in the liver and spaces among renal tubules in the kidney (Figure 6B,D,F). Giemsa staining of BM showed a high percentage of blasts (Figure 6H), in accordance with a high percentage of both GFP/c-kit double-positive cells by flow cytometolic analysis.

In contrast, the remaining 4 morbid mice/D171N diagnosed as MDS (mouse IDs 9 and 11) or MDS/AML (mouse IDs 10 and 17) showed heterologous phenotypes of GFP+ BM cells (data not shown). Although mouse IDs 9 and 17 displayed hepatosplenomegaly like other mice/D171N, they exhibited leukocytopenia with fewer blasts.  AML1-D171N collaborated with Evi1 in inducing MDS/AML  We then asked why even the same point mutant of AML1 caused different phenotypes of MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML. We assumed the possibility that the integration of retroviruses influenced the outcomes in the BMT model. To explore this, we first performed Southern blot analysis of BM of the morbid mice. A single or several proviral integrations were confirmed (Figure 7A). Next, we used the bubble PCR method to identify the integrated sites.7,44,45 A single or 2 integration sites were identified in each sample (Table 1). Interestingly, integrations near Evi1 site were found in 7 of 15 genomic DNA samples of BM cells derived from mice/D171N, but not from mice/S291fs. Moreover, retrospective examination revealed that these 7 mice presented nearly identical phenotypes, characterized by marked hepatosplenomegaly (Figure 6A), leukocytosis (Figure 3A), and biphenotypic surface markers (CD11b+ and B220+) of the leukemic cells (Figure 5), thus constituting a definite subgroup among mice/D171N. Southern blot analysis showed that all of the leukemic mice with high expression of Evi1 are monoclonal (except for mouse IDs 15 and 19), but the other leukemic mice without high expression of Evi1 are oligoclonal or have several integrations (Figure 7A). Noteworthy was the finding that the Evi1 site was not identified from the genomic DNA samples of mice/S291fs, even though the Evi1 site is a known common integration site of retroviruses.31â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“38 These led us to postulate that Evi1 collaborated with AML1-D171N in inducing the distinct type of MDS/AML. To test this, we examined whether the expression of Evi1 was enhanced in the BM cells in which the integration into an Evi1 site was identified. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of Evi1 were high in all the related samples (Figure 7C). Protein expression levels corresponded to mRNA expression levels of Evi1 (Figure 7D; data not shown). Interestingly, 4 samples derived from mice/D171N harboring no integration near Evi1 also displayed significantly high expression levels of Evi1 (mouse IDs 13, 19, 20, and 22), and the phenotypes of these mice were identical to those induced by AML1-D171Nâ€“transduced cells in which retroviruses were integrated into the Evi1 site. In these cases, the expression of Evi1 might have been enhanced secondarily by an unknown mechanism, or we simply failed to detect the integration site. The latter possibility was supported by the fact that multiple integrations were detected in these cases (Figure 7A; mouse IDs 13, 19, and 20). In any case, all the mice/D171N with enhanced expression of Evi1 in their BM cells displayed high percentages of blasts (Figure S1). We also examined whether the expression of MDS1/Evi1 was enhanced by the integration into an Evi1 site. The MDS1 gene is located approximately 240 kb upstream of Evi1, and MDS1/Evi1 is generated from the in-frame splicing of MDS1 to the second exon of Evi1.36,43 Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of MDS1/Evi1 were low and were not significantly increased when compared with controls (data not shown). The integration sites of Evi1 were focused on two regions (Table 1). One is 15 kb upstream of start site of Evi1 (mouse IDs 12, 14, 15), and another is 107 kb upstream of start site of Evi1 (mouse IDs 4, 6, 7, 26). Morishita et al reported that the retrovirus integrations had occurred near or in 5â€² noncoding exons of Evi1 gene.31 The integration site at 15 kb upstream of the start site of Evi1 that we found is near to the site they reported.

In addition to 6 samples from mice/D171N harboring integration near Evi1 (mouse IDs 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, and 15), 4 samples derived from mice/D171N without integration near Evi1 display high expression levels of Evi1 (mouse IDs 13, 19, 20, and 22). RNA from normal BM cells served as a control (RNA level = 1). (D) Western blot of lysates from spleen cells of mice/D171N, mice/WT, and normal mice and PLAT-E as controls. Samples from mice/D171N confirmed high expression of Evi1 by RT-PCR showed expression of the protein (mouse IDs 6, 15, 20, and 22), but the other mice without high expression of Evi1 by RT-PCR did not express the protein (mouse IDs 11, 17, and 105). View inlineView popup Table 1 Analysis of integration site In vivo collaboration between Evi1 and AML1-D171N  Next, we tested to see if Evi1 expression collaborates with AML1-D171N in inducing leukemia in the BMT model. Cotransduction of AML1-D171N and Evi1 into BM cells resulted in rapid induction of the disease in the mice that underwent transplantation that was essentially identical with the disease that developed after a long latency in the mice/D171N (Figures 1E,5). In fact, all the mice displayed increased number of blasts in the PB within a month after the transplantation of BM cells transduced with Evi1/D171N. Southern blot analysis showed that these leukemic cells were polyclonal (Figure 7B). These results indicate that AML1-D171N and Evi1 collaborate to induce MDS/AML with a distinct phenotype. On the other hand, cotransduction of AML1-S291fs and Evi1 into BM cells did not induce MDS/AML in 5 months (data not shown). In the present work, mice that received transplants of BM cellâ€“transduced Evi1 alone did not present any abnormalities in 5 months (Figure 1E).  AML1-S291fs induced erythroid dysplasia with pancytopenia  In contrast to mice/D171N, most of mice/S291fs displayed remarkable erythroid dysplasia with continuous pancytopenia (Figures 3A-C,4A). A total of 2 of 8 mice/S291fs died of MDS-RAEB in which the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow was less than 20%, and 5 mice/S291fs developed MDS/AML. The mice displayed severe anemia but not leukocytosis in the PB, and the numbers of blasts were generally lower than those of MDS/AML mice transduced with AML1-D171N (Table S2). Surface markers of leukemic cells derived from mice/S291fs were different from those of mice/D171N (Figure S3).  We found integrations of the retrovirus in the intron of MN1 in 3 of 8 mice/S291fs (Table 1; mouse IDs 55, 56, and 58), and MN1 was overexpressed in the leukemic cells of these mice (Figure S2). The integration site was identical among these leukemic cells, indicating that leukemic cells of the 3 mice were derived from a single hematopoietic progenitor and that overexpression of MN1 induced expansion of the transduced stem cells during the 3-day culture period before the transplantation. Indeed, the mice with the integration at that MN1 site developed MDS/AML with shorter latencies (Table S2).  Discussion  We have established a mouse BMT model for MDS and MDS/AML using AML1 mutants derived from patients with MDS, although previous studies either using similar BMT models or knock-in mice of AML1 mutants failed to do so. There are several potential explanations for this discrepancy. First, because most AML1 mutants work as dominant-negative forms, high expression levels of the mutants would be critical to effectively inhibit WT AML1. In this aspect, our BMT model has an advantage, using the efficient retrovirus vector pMYs40 designed to achieve high expression in hematopoietic progenitor cells and, unlike most other retrovirus vectors, harbors splice donor and acceptor sites derived from the MFG vector to increase expression levels.40,47 Second, using the efficient packaging cell line Plat-E,39 we achieved high titers of retroviruses (average: 107 infection U/mL), which could result in the higher numbers of retrovirus integrations. This also increases the probabilities of up-regulating or disrupting important genes that collaborate with AML1 mutants in inducing MDS and/or MDS/AML. Alternatively, it is also possible that the positions of AML1 mutations are critical for the biological effect. We believe that the combination of these factors has put our system into practice.  In the present MDS model, we used 2 AML1 mutants, D171N and S291fsX300. The latter, a C-terminalâ€“truncated form, is more potent as a dominant-negative form than the former, which harbors a point mutation in the RHD.25,26 In this context, it is reasonable that the S291fs mutant induced the disease in the mice that underwent transplantation with a higher penetrance (Figure 1D). More important, expression of these mutants induced MDS/AML of distinct phenotypes in the mice that underwent transplantation: AML1-S291fs induced pancytopenia associated with dysplasia in the erythroid lineage, while AML1-D171N frequently induced hepatoslenomegaly and leukocytosis associated with marked myeloid dysplasia. This suggests that even different mutations of the same gene could induce heterogeneous diseases. As previously described,25,26 AML1-D171N lost DNA-binding ability and hence transactivation potential because it possessed a point mutation in RHD essential for DNA-binding, while AML1-S291fs had increased DNA-binding ability but lost transactivation potential because it had an intact RHD but lacked a C-terminal transactivation domain. Thus, the different biological outcomes induced by AML1 mutants could be explained in part by structural and functional differences between the mutants. In addition to the dominant-negative functions, these mutants may also have gain of function; the fact that AML1-KO mice did not develop leukemia18 indicates that deletion of AML1 alone is not sufficient to induce leukemia, suggesting the possibility that the AML1 mutants have gain of function as well. Because AML1 associates and forms a ternary complex with other transcriptional factors and cofactors via its specific domains, it is possible that these mutants exert different effects on the proliferation and differentiation of BM cells in the various contexts.  In BMT models using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, the genes near the retrovirus integration sites are thought to affect the outcomes.30â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“38 This sometimes obscures the significance of the transduced gene, but simultaneously will give us clues to understanding the collaboration of multiple genes in the development of leukemias. One of the intriguing findings of the present work is that high expression of Evi1, either caused by virus integration or by unknown mechanisms, was able to collaborate with AML1-D171N in inducing the homogeneous disease characterized by leukocytosis, severe myelodysplasia, and marked hepatosplenomegaly that always developed to overt leukemia with high percentages of B220+ and CD11b+ blasts. Together with the recent findings that Evi1 expression was observed in patients with MDS and AML,36,48 and that Evi1 alone did not induce AML in mouse models,14,34,49,50 our result strongly suggested that AML1-D171N collaborated with Evi1 in inducing MDS/AML. It is interesting to note that AML1-S291fs never collaborated with Evi1 during our examination (Table 1), again suggesting that these 2 AML1 mutations transform hematopoietic cells through distinct mechanisms. Importantly, we confirmed the collaboration between AML1-D171N and Evi1 in an in vivo experiment. Cotransduction of AML1-D171N and Evi1 into BM cells resulted in rapid induction of MDS/AML in the mice that received transplants. In addition, the leukemic cells in most of these mice included more clones than those in mice/D171N (Figure 7B), indicating cooperation of Evi1 and AML1-D171N. However, leukemic cells from one mouse (ID 305) seemed to be monoclonal and to contribute to oligoclonal leukemia of mouse 304. In addition, it took 2 to 3 months for leukemias induced by the combination of AML1-D171N and Evi1 to kill the mice that received transplants. Together, these result suggested that while AML1-D171N and Evi1 overexpression collaborated in inducing leukemia, additional steps were required for efficient transformation of hematopoietic progenitors. In the absence of Evi1 high expression, AML1-D171N caused MDS or MDS/AML with low percentages of blasts in BM but still with hepatosplenomegaly. This indicates that hepatosplenomegaly had something to do with AML1-D171N.  In contrast to mice/D171N, most mice/S291fs succumbed to either MDS-RAEB with fatal severe anemia following continuous pancytopenia or MDS/AML without leukocytosis. The integration site in the intron 1 of the MN1 gene found in leukemic cells of 3 mice was derived from the same cell. We also found that MN1 was overexpressed in the leukemic cells of these mice, suggesting that overexpression of MN1 induced effective expansion of leukemic stem cells. Recently, Heuser et al reported that high expression of MN1 correlated with poor outcome in AML with normal cytogenetics.51 Moreover, Slape et al identified MN1 as potential collaborators of NUP98/HOXD13 to induce leukemia.42 Further work will be required to investigate the role of MN1 in MDS/AML.  One fundamental question of this study was whether AML1 mutants alone induce MDS and MDS/AML. In our experiments, 5 of the 6 surviving mice/D171N showed a disappearance of GFP+ cells in time, suggesting that AML1-D171N alone was not able to induce MDS/AML. Previous studies using gene-engineered mice and a BMT model demonstrated that AML1 fusions caused by chromosomal translocations alone were insufficient to induce AML,7â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“12 except for AML1-MDS1-Evi1, which by itself induced AML with a long latency.52 In addition, several lines of evidence30â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“38 that implicated the integration site of retroviruses for different biological outcomes led us to consider the same possibility in this BMT model. Indeed, we identified frequent retrovirus integrations near the Evi1 gene in the BM cells derived from mice/D171N whose leukemic cells displayed nearly identical phenotypes and concomitant elevated expression of Evi1. Importantly, coexpression of AML1-D171N and Evi1 induced the same leukemia with shorther latencies, demonstrating the collaboration between AML1-D171N and Evi1 in vivo. These results showed the power of in vivo insertional mutagenesis of retroviruses in a search for genes involved in the pathogenesis of MDS and MDS/AML.  Finally, it is important to relate these in vivo results to clinical data of the human disease. The recent finding25â‡“â€“27 that AML1 point mutations in the C-terminal regions were almost exclusively found in MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML, but not in de novo AML, coincided with our data that AML1-S291fs tended to induce MDS-RAEBâ€“like symptoms in this BMT model. Clinical findings25â‡“â€“27 that the RHD point mutation was often found in de novo AML, mainly AML M0, in addition to MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML, was also in accordance with our data that AML1-D171N induced more progressive MDS/AML with higher percentages of blasts when compared with AML1-S291fs. Classification of MDS and MDS/AML is always controversial because of the heterogeneity of the disease.1,2,27 In the future, this disease will be reclassified based on genetic alterations and their combinations.  In summary, we have generated a mouse BMT model of MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML. The current BMT model, mimicking AML1-related MDS, will be useful for understanding molecular pathogenesis and establishing new therapeutic strategy for MDS and MDS/AML. AML1/RUNX1, located on chromosome band 21q22, is one of the most important hematopoietic transcription factors. AML1 is frequently affected in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome with 21q22 translocations. Recently, AML1 mutations were found in adult hematologic malignancies, especially acute myeloid leukemia (AML)â€“M0 or leukemia with acquired trisomy 21, and familial platelet disorder with a predisposition toward AML. Through the use of polymerase chain reactionâ€“single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, we examined the AML1 gene for mutations in 241 patients with pediatric hematologic malignancies, and we detected AML1 mutations in seven patients (2.9%). Deletion was found in one patient, and point mutations in four patients, including three missense mutations, two silent mutations, and one mutation within an intron resulting in an abnormal splice acceptor site. All of the mutations except for one were heterozygous. Mutations within the runt domain were found in six of seven patients. Six of seven patients with AML1 mutations were diagnosed with AML, and one had acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In three of these seven patients, AML evolved from other hematologic disorders. AML1 mutations were found in two of four AML-M0 and two of three patients with acquired trisomy 21. Patients with AML1 mutations tended to be older children. Three of four patients with AML1 mutations who received stem cell transplantation (SCT) are alive, whereas the remaining three patients with mutations without SCT died. These results suggest that AML1 mutations in pediatric hematologic malignancies are infrequent, but are possibly related to AML-M0, acquired trisomy 21, and leukemic transformation. These patients may have a poor clinical outcome. Â© 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc. INTRODUCTION  The AML1/RUNX1 gene is located on chromosome band 21q22 and is recognized as an essential transcription factor for normal hematopoiesis, composed of AML1 and core-binding factor (CBF) Î²â€“DNA complex (Okuda et al., 2001). AML1 is frequently affected in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with 21q22 translocations, including t(8;21)(q22;q22) (AML1-MTG8/ETO) (Miyoshi et al., 1991), t(3;21)(q26;q22) (AML1-EVI1/EAP/MDS1) (Mitani et al., 1994; Nucifora et al., 1994), t(16;21)(q24;q22) (AML1-MTG16) (Gamou et al., 1998), and t(12;21)(p13;q22) (TEL-AML1) (Golub et al., 1995; Romana et al., 1995). In all of these fusion transcripts, the whole runt domain encoding the DNA binding of AML1 is retained; however, in TEL-AML1, only the whole transactivation domain is retained. Therefore, the runt domain of AML1 is considered to play an important role in leukemogenesis. Recently, AML1 mutations were found in leukemia (Osato et al., 1999; Preudhomme et al., 2000), MDS (Imai et al., 2000), and familial platelet disorder with a propensity to develop acute myeloid leukemia (FPD/AML) (Song et al., 1999; Buijs et al., 2001). Most of the mutations were clustered within the runt domain of AML1, and the function of these mutants was decreased or lost (Osato et al., 1999; Imai et al., 2000; Michaud et al., 2002). AML1 mutations are frequently found in AML-M0 and myeloid malignancies with acquired trisomy 21 in adults (Osato et al., 1999; Preudhomme et al., 2000; Langabeer et al., 2002). There have been no reports of AML1 mutations in pediatric hematologic malignancies. We therefore examined AML1 mutations in pediatric hematologic malignancies and evaluated the relationship between AML1 mutations and the clinical features. MATERIALS AND METHODS  Patient Samples  We analyzed 241 pediatric patients (age, 0â€“15 years; median, 6 years) with hematologic malignancies, including 100 patients with AML (including 25 with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia [AMKL] and Down syndrome), 30 with MDS, five with CML (three chronic phase and two blastic crisis), 106 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in addition to 75 normal healthy donors (Table 1). AML, MDS, and CML patients were treated between 1991 and 1999, and ALL patients were treated between 1995 and 1999 in several institutes in Japan. These patients were diagnosed according to the morphological and immunophenotypic criteria of the Frenchâ€“Americanâ€“British (FAB) classification (Bennett et al., 1991). AML patients were treated with the Japanese childhood AML protocol of the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan, and ALL patients were mainly treated with the Tokyo Children&#x27;s Cancer Study Group (TCCSG) L95-14 protocol (Tsuchida et al., 2000). Some patients were treated with the modified TCCSG L95-14 protocol. MDS and CML patients were treated according to the protocol of each institute. Informed consent was obtained from all of these patients or their parents and from the normal healthy donors.  Table 1.

We analyzed mutations in the runt domain of AML1 by PCR or reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) (Takita et al., 2001). The primers used for these analyses were the same as those used in previous studies (Song et al., 1999; Imai et al., 2000). DNA (50 ng) or 1 Î¼l of the cDNA solution was amplified by PCR in a total volume of 10 Î¼l with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.001% (wt/vol) gelatin, 5% DMSO, 250 Î¼M of each dNTP, 1.14 Î¼Ci of [Î±-32P]dCTP, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (AmpliTaq Gold; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and 10 pmol of each primer. PCR amplification was performed with this mixture by use of a DNA thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: after initial denaturation at 95Â°C for 9 min, 35 cycles at 95Â°C for 30 sec, 60Â°C for 30 sec, and 72Â°C for 1 min, followed by a final elongation at 72Â°C for 7 min. The PCR products were denatured and loaded on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 5% polyacrylamide (99:1 acrylamide to bisacrylamide) and TME (30 mM Tris; 35 mM MES {2-[N-morpholine] ethanesulfonic acid}, Dojin Chemicals; 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 6.8), and electrophoresed in TME buffer at room temperature (Takita et al., 2001). The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR films (Kodak, Rochester, NY) for 12 hr at room temperature. Sequence Analysis  The PCR products showing an abnormal bandshift in SSCP were subcloned into a pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitogen, Carlsbad, CA) (Taketani et al., 2002a) and were sequenced in both directions to confirm the mutations. Statistical Analysis  We used the nonparametric Mannâ€“Whitney t test or Fisher&#x27;s exact test to compare the clinical characteristics between the patients with and those without AML1 mutations. RESULTS  In 241 pediatric hematologic malignancies, AML1 mutations were found in seven patients (2.9%) (Tables 1 and 2), including two patients with AML-M0 (patients 1 and 2), one each with AML-M1 (patient 3), AML-M4 (patients 4 and 5), AML with lymphoid characteristics (patient 6), and one with B-precursor ALL (patient 7). No mutations were detected in de novo MDS and CML. Among 75 normal healthy donors, only one AML1 polymorphism was detected (Table 2). Chromosomal analysis of these patients showed acquired trisomy 21 in two patients (patients 3 and 6), âˆ’7/7qâˆ’ in two (patients 1 and 4), a normal karyotype in two (patients 2 and 7), and t(9;22)(q34;q11) in one (patient 5). No mutations were found in 25 AMKL patients with constitutional trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) and in acute leukemias with 21q22 translocations, including eight AMLs with t(8;21)(q22;q22) and 11 ALLs with t(12;21)(p13;q22).

D43968) in exon 3 was detected, resulting in a stop codon (Fig. 1A). Patients 3, 4, and 5 had missense mutations: Leu117Pro (T1928C substitution), Asp171Asn (G2089A), and Arg49His (G1724A), respectively (Fig. 1B, C). Patients 2 and 7 had the same silent mutation: Ile87Ile (C1839A). In patient 6, a point mutation occurred in intron 3 (intervening sequence 3â€“10;tâ†’a). Because this alteration produced AG, a splicing acceptor site, mutant AML1 mRNA was added to the 8-bp insertion in intron 3, which led to a stop codon. One normal healthy donor in 75 had a missense mutation of Gly42Arg (G1702C). All of the mutations, except for that in patient 3, were heterozygous because analysis of the direct sequencing confirmed that all patients with AML1 mutations had both one mutated allele and one normal allele (data not shown). SSCP analysis showed that the remaining normal band was absent in patient 3 (Fig. 1B). Mutations within the runt domain (codons 50 to 177) were found in six patients, and outside in one patient, and in one normal healthy donor (Fig. 2).  Figure 1.  Figure 1.

A comparison of the clinical characteristics between patients with or without AML1 mutations showed that the white blood cell and platelet counts at onset, sex, immunophenotype, hepatosplenomegaly, and involvement of the central nervous system had no relation to AML1 mutations (data not shown). The age of patients with AML1 mutation was 2â€“14 years (median, 10 years), whereas that of patients without AML1 mutation was 0â€“15 years (median, 6 years). Because of the small sample size, the difference between the two groups was not significant. With regard to the prognosis of seven patients with AML1 mutations, three of four patients treated with stem cell transplantation (SCT) are alive, whereas the remaining three patients without SCT died. In three (patients 3, 4, and 6) of seven patients with AML1 mutations, acute leukemia evolved from other hematologic disorders. Patient 3 was initially diagnosed with severe congenital neutropenia (Kostmann syndrome) and was treated with granulocyteâ€“colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). She had mutations of both the elastase2 and G-CSF receptor genes. When she developed AML-M1, both trisomy 21 and an AML1 mutation appeared in her bone marrow cells. Patient 4, who was initially diagnosed with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), was treated with VP16, AraC, and anthracyclines. She developed AML-M4 9 months after the diagnosis. Patient 6 had been diagnosed with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia with a normal karyotype 4 years previously. She developed AML with a lymphoid marker and rearrangements of the IG and TCR genes accompanied by the presence of both trisomy 21 and an AML1 mutation. Interestingly, her leukemic cells were negative for myeloperoxidase before she was treated with SCT, suggesting the lineage switch to ALL.  RT-PCRâ€“SSCP and sequence analyses also revealed two novel splicing forms of AML1 in three ALL patients, including two with B-precursor ALL and one with T-ALL. In patient 8, although exon 5 was spliced out, this altered AML1 gene was transcribed in frame (Fig. 1D). In patients 9 and 10, an 11-bp deletion in exon 6 (nts 1848 to 1859), which was induced by recognition of AG (nts 1858â€“1859) as a splicing acceptor site, led to a stop codon (Fig. 1E). Age, the white blood cell and platelet counts at onset, sex, immunophenotype, and chromosomal findings had no relation to AML1 mutations (data not shown). All of these patients are still alive. DISCUSSION  In this study, we investigated AML1 mutations in pediatric hematologic malignancies. We found AML1 mutations in seven (2.9%) of 241 patients with pediatric hematologic disorders. Previous studies showed that AML1 mutations, including insertion, deletion, or duplication, were detected in AML, MDS, CML, and ALL, but not in any leukemia cell lines (Osato et al., 1999; Imai et al., 2000; Preudhomme et al., 2000; Vegesna et al., 2002). AML1 germline mutations were also found in FPD/AML (Song et al., 1999; Buijs et al., 2001). The frequency of AML1 mutations in pediatric AML in this study was six (6.0%) of 100, which was almost similar to that of adult AML (six of 109 [5.5%] [Osato et al., 1999] and 11 of 131 [8.4%] [Preudhomme et al., 2000]), whereas that of AML1 mutations in pediatric ALL was one of 116 (0.9%) compared with one of 37 (2.7%) in adult ALL (Osato et al., 1999). The incidence of AML1 mutations was 50% (two of four) in AML-M0 and 4.1% (three of 74) in other FAB subtypes of AML, respectively. AML1 mutations in adult patients were more frequently found in AML-M0 and in myeloid malignancies with acquired trisomy 21, less frequently in CML and ALL (Osato et al., 1999; Preudhomme et al., 2000; Steer et al., 2001; Langabeer et al., 2002). In pediatric AML-M0, the frequency of AML1 mutations was as high as that in adults. AML1 mutations in AML-M0 might lead to prematurely terminating mutations because AML1 protein regulates the myeloperoxidase gene, and AML-M0 was negative for myeloperoxidase (Osato et al., 1999; Preudhomme et al., 2000). Most mutations in adult AML-M0 are biallelic mutations. However, a monoallelic mutation was found in two AML-M0 pediatric patients in this study. The frequency of AML1 mutations in this study may not be accurate because the patients enrolled in this study were not sequential and our selection of patients was biased. A large sequential prospective study is needed to elucidate the exact incidence of AML1 mutations in pediatric hematologic malignancies.  Most of the mutations were clustered within the runt domain of AML1, whereas the other AML1 allele was wild-type, and showed loss of heterozygosity, or another mutation. Mutant analysis in vitro showed that the functions of AML1, DNA-binding and transactivation activities, were almost all decreased or lost (Osato et al., 1999; Imai et al., 2000; Michaud et al., 2002). The 55-bp deletion in patient 1 and the point mutation of intron 3 in patient 6 caused a frameshift, leading to a stop codon. These alterations resulted in a truncated AML1 protein, lacking a runt domain and transactivation domain. These truncated proteins would decrease or lose the activities of DNA binding, and of CBFÎ² interaction and transactivation. Asp171 makes a hydrogen bond with Arg174 and fixes the orientation for interaction with the DNA (Tahirov et al., 2001); therefore, Asp171 is one of the essential residues for DNA binding. An in vitro assay also revealed that the Asp171Ala mutant decreased both DNA binding and heterodimerization with CBFÎ² (Tahirov et al., 2001). Asp171Asn in patient 4 might have a function similar to that of the Asp171Ala mutant. Leu117 consists of runt domain loop Î²D (Warren et al., 2000). This loop, which is not implicated in DNA binding, makes a number of contacts with CBFÎ² through the side chain of Tyr113. Leu117Pro substitution in patient 3 leads to a decline in heterodimerization with CBFÎ². Arg49 exists outside the runt domain, but is highly conserved in three human AML1 family proteins (AML1, AML2, and AML3) as well as in AML1 homologs of several species. This implies that this residue is an important residue of AML1 and that this mutant may compromise AML1 function or conformation. A silent mutation, Ile87Ile, in patients 2 and 7 was previously reported in Japanese leukemia patients (Osato et al., 1999). Although no mutations or polymorphisms of the runt domain of AML1 were found in normal healthy donors in this and previous studies (Osato et al., 1999; Preudhomme et al., 2000), this mutation might be a polymorphism peculiar to the Japanese because it was detected only in Japanese patients. However, it is unknown whether the silent mutation affects the function of AML1.  Chromosomal analysis revealed that AML1 mutations were found in two of three patients with acquired trisomy 21: two AML patients, and one with ALL. A high incidence of AML1 mutations in myeloid malignancies with acquired trisomy 21 (Preudhomme et al., 2000) and a low incidence in hematologic disorders with constitutional trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) were previously reported (Taketani et al., 2002c). It was reported that acquired trisomy 21 appeared when some patients with Kostmann syndrome or 8p11 myeloproliferative disorder developed AML (Kalra et al., 1995; Macdonald et al., 2002). Patient 4 also developed AML from RAEB-T, although the chromosomal abnormality did not show trisomy 21, but 7qâˆ’. We could not examine AML1 mutations at the time of initial diagnosis of these patients because the samples were not available. However, these results suggest that the occurrence of the AML1 mutation might be associated with leukemic transformation of MDS or other hematological diseases.  Clinically, AML1 mutations were found in older pediatric patients (median, 10 years) compared with pediatric patients without AML1 mutation (median, 6 years). The clinical outcome of patients with AML1 mutations has not been reported previously. In this study, all of the patients treated with SCT are alive except for patient 6, who died of a treatment-related disorder. The remaining three patients who did not receive SCT died. Further investigation of a larger number of patients is needed to clarify whether pediatric patients with AML1 mutations have a dismal prognosis.  AML1 has three main types of alternative splicing forms with a runt domain (Miyoshi et al., 1995). Furthermore, there were a large variety of spliced AML1 transcripts, including splicing out of exon 6, exon 2â€“3, and exon 3 (Levanon et al., 1996; Chimienti et al., 2000). We detected two new spliced forms of AML1. No mutations were detected at an exonâ€“intron boundary by direct sequence analysis (data not shown). These spliced forms were quantitatively smaller than normal AML1 because the aberrant band was weaker than the normal band. It was reported that AML1a overexpression, which lacked a transactivation domain, suppressed granulocytic differentiation and stimulated cell proliferation in 32Dcl3 murine myeloid cells, but these AML1a effects were canceled by the concomitant overexpression of AML1b (Tanaka et al., 1995). The spliced form of the 11-bp deletion in exon 6 was structurally similar to AML1a. This suggested that a small number of spliced transcripts might not influence the function of the normal AML1 transcript.  In conclusion, our results showed that AML1 mutations in pediatric hematologic malignancies are infrequent, but are related to AML-M0, acquired trisomy 21, and leukemic transformation. Patients with this mutation may have a poor clinical outcome. Somatically acquired point mutations of AML1/RUNX1 gene have been recently identified in rare cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Moreover, germ line mutations of AML1 were found in an autosomal dominant disease, familial platelet disorder with predisposition to AML (FPD/AML), suggesting that AML1 mutants, as well as AML1 chimeras, contribute to the transformation of hematopoietic progenitors. In this report, we showed that AML1 point mutations were found in 6 (46%) of 13 MDS patients among atomic bomb (A-bomb) survivors in Hiroshima. Unlike acute or chronic leukemia patients among A-bomb survivors, MDS patients exposed relatively low-dose radiation and developed the disease after a long latency period. AML1 mutations also were found in 5 (38%) of 13 therapy-related AML/MDS patients who were treated with alkylating agents with or without local radiation therapy. In contrast, frequency of AML1 mutation in sporadic MDS patients was 2.7% (2 of 74). Among AML1 mutations identified in this study, truncated-type mutants lost DNA binding potential and trans-activation activity. All missense mutations with one exception (Gly42Arg) lacked DNA binding ability and down-regulated the trans-activation potential of wild-type AML1 in a dominant-negative fashion. The Gly42Arg mutation that was shared by 2 patients bound DNA even more avidly than wild-type AML1 and enhanced thetrans-activation potential of normal AML1. These results suggest that AML1 point mutations are related to low-dose radiation or alkylating agents and play a role distinct from that of leukemogenic chimeras as a result of chromosomal translocations caused by sublethal radiation or topoisomerase II inhibitors.  Introduction  Genes encoding transcription factors that play critical roles in hematopoiesis are frequently involved in the genetic alterations in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A good example is AML1/RUNX1/CBFA2, which encodes a component of the AML1â€“core binding factor Î² (CBFÎ²) transcriptional factor complex. Analysis of AML1- and CBFÎ²-deficient mice revealed that both factors are indispensable for the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis.1-5 AML1 is also well known as one of the genes most frequently involved in the chromosomal translocations of human leukemia.6 It is generally accepted that the AML1-ETO fusion transcription factor that is created by the 8;21 translocations contributes to leukemogenesis through suppression of the trans-activation potential of the AML1-CBFÎ² complex in a dominant-negative fashion.7  In addition to chromosomal translocations, recent studies have identified several somatically acquired point mutations of theAML1 gene that occurred exclusively within the DNA bindingrunt homology domain (RHD) in sporadic AML/MDS patients.8 9 Because of the low frequencies of point mutations (0%-7.1%) and the divergent effects of these mutants on thetrans-activation activity of the AML1-CBFÎ² complex,8 the biologic significance of these mutations in the malignant transformation of hematopoietic progenitors was initially controversial. Recent findings, however, support the hypothesis that AML1 point mutations contribute to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). First, it has been demonstrated that AML1 mutations occurred at a substantially higher frequency in specific subtypes of AML, such as poorly differentiated AML M0 (22%) and myeloid malignancies associated with acquired trisomy 21 (38%).10 Second, germ line mutations of AML1 have been shown to occur in a rare autosomal dominant disorder, familial platelet disorder with predisposition to AML (FPD/AML).11 12 Third, many of the point mutations identified in the diseases mentioned above have been found to overlap. Finally, the crystal structure of the RHD-CBFÎ²-DNA ternary complex has been determined,13-16 and it has been revealed that most of the amino acid residues replaced by the missense mutations were those that directly contact DNA.  The AML1 gene also was reported as a target of gene alteration by ionizing radiation (IR) and anticancer drugs in experimental systems.17 18 Moreover, human leukemias associated with AML1 gene translocations after anticancer therapy or low-dose radiation have been reported,19 20although the role of radiation in these patients is controversial.21 In this report, we tested the frequency of point mutations in the AML1 gene in MDS patients among atomic bomb (A-bomb) survivors in Hiroshima, as well as in therapy-related MDS/AML. We found unexpectedly high frequencies ofAML1 mutations in these patients, suggesting that radiation and anticancer drugs contribute to the development of MDS/AML through mutations of the AML1 gene.  Patients and methods  Patients&#x27; materials  We examined 74 cases of sporadic MDS and 13 cases of MDS among A-bomb survivors, who were diagnosed at Hiroshima University Hospital between 1995 and 2001. According to the Dosimetry System 1986 (DS86), free-in-air kerma at a distance of 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 km from the hypocenter of Hiroshima is approximately 4, 0.5, 0.07, and 0.01 Gy, respectively.22 23 Taking account of exposure from residual radiation, we defined those who exposed A-bomb within 3 km of the hypocenter as A-bomb survivors. We also examined 6 cases of therapy-related MDS/AML, 67 cases of myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) in the chronic phase (13 myelofibrosis [MF], 21 essential thrombocythemia [ET], 12 polycythemia vera [PV], 1 atypical MPD, and 20 chronic myeloid leukemia [CML]), 2 cases of paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria (PNH), 2 cases of CML in blast crisis, 7 cases of secondary leukemia (1 MF, 2 ET, 3 PV, and 1 PNH), and 30 cases of healthy volunteers. Diagnosis was based on morphologic and immunophenotypic studies according to French-American-British (FAB) classification.24 Cytogenetic analyses with standard procedures were performed according to the International System of Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (1995). Patient samples were taken after obtaining informed consent and approval from the institutional review board at Hiroshima University. Mononuclear cells were isolated from bone marrow or peripheral blood samples by Ficoll-Conray density gradient centrifugation. Genomic DNA was extracted with a Puregene Kit (Gentra, Minneapolis, MN), and total RNA was extracted using a TRIzol Kit (Gibco Life Technologies, Rockville, MD), according to the manufacturers&#x27; instructions.  Polymerase chain reactionâ€“single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP)  100 ng genomic DNA was amplified by PCR in a total volume of 20 Î¼L containing 1â€‰Ã— PCR buffer (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA), 0.2 mM dNTP (deoxynucleoside triphosphate; Perkin-Elmer), 0.2 Î¼M of each primer, and 0.5 unit of AmpliTaq (Perkin-Elmer). PCR of exons 3 through 5 of the AML1 gene performed using the following flanking intronic, forward/reverse primers; 5â€²-AGCTGTTTGCAGGGTCCTAA-3â€²/5â€²-GTCCTCCCACCACCCTCT-3â€² for exon 3, 5â€²-CATTGCTATTCCTCTGCAACC-3â€²/5-CCATGAAACGTGTTTCAAGC-3â€² for exon 4, and 5â€²-CCACCAACCTCATTCTGTTT-3â€²/5â€²-AGACATGGTCCCTGAGTATA-3â€² for exon 5. To identify AML1 mutations, SSCP analysis was performed on a GenePhor system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, England) using 12.5% GeneGel Excel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After electrophoresis, gels were silver-stained to visualize the bands. All PCR products with abnormal SSCP bands were confirmed by an independent amplification and SSCP analysis.  Identification of AML1 mutations  PCR products that showed abnormal bands were subcloned into a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and 8 independent clones were sequenced in both directions using BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer) and analyzed on ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Perkin-Elmer). To confirm mutations, PCR products from cDNA were also sequenced. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using total RNA and random hexamers with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Gibco). The cDNA products were amplified with the following primers: 5â€²-GCAGGGTCCTAACTCAATCG-3â€²/5â€²-GCTCGGAAAAGGACAAGCTC-3â€², and subcloned PCR products were sequenced as described above.  Cell culture and transfection  The cell lines Cos-7 and HeLa were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (Gibco), and U937 in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cos-7 cells were transfected using SuperFect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions. For reporter assay, HeLa cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method25 and U937 cells by Effectene (Qiagen).  Plasmid constructions  The entire coding regions of wild-type AML1 or CBFÎ² generated by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). PCR-generated fragments encoding AML1 or AML1 mutants with an N-terminus FLAG (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) epitope were also subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector. The integrity of the amplified sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A reporter plasmid containing a macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR) promoter (pM-CSF-R-luc)26 was kindly provided by Dr D. Zhang (Beth Israel Hospital and Harvard Medical School).  Immunoprecipitations and Western blot analysis  Cos-7 cells were transfected using Superfect (Qiagen) with 5 Î¼g of pcDNA3.1-CBFÎ² and 5 Î¼g FLAG-tagged AML1 or AML1 mutants expression plasmid. After 24 hours, the cells were lysed in the lysis buffer (20 mM Tris[tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane]-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 1% Nonidet P40; 1 mM phenylmethlsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF); 1 Î¼g/mL leupeptin). The lysates were sonicated and then incubated with protein G (Pharmacia Biotech) to block nonspecific binding proteins. A portion of each lysate was removed for immunoblot analysis. A 20-Î¼L volume of a 50% slurry of antiâ€“FLAG M2 beads (Sigma, St Louis, MO) was added to the lysates, incubated for 4 hours at 4Â°C, and washed 3 times with lysis buffer. FLAG beads were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin prior to addition to the lysates. For Western blot, the lysates or the supernatants from immune complex beads after boiling in Laemmli buffer were separated by 15% sodium dodecyl sulfateâ€“polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and transferred to Hybond ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBS-T (0.1% Tween-20) and hybridized sequentially with primary antibodies and a horseradish peroxidaseâ€“conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The primary antibodies used in this study were anti-M2 antibody (Sigma), anti-AML1 polyclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products, Boston MA), and anti-CBFÎ² polyclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products). Bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using a Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  Electrophoretic mobility shift assay  Nuclear extracts from Cos-7 cells, which were transiently transfected with the corresponding expression plasmid, were prepared as described previously.27 Protein concentrations were determined with Bradford reagents (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed as previously described.28 DNA binding reactions were prepared in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-Nâ€²-2-ethanesulfonic acid), 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ethylene glycol-bis (Î²-aminoethylether)-N, N, Nâ€², Nâ€²-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 0.4 mM dithiothreitol, 40 mM KCl, and 60 Î¼g of salmon sperm DNA per milliliter. Annealed oligomers containing the AML1 binding site were labeled with Î±-[32P]dATP (deoxyadenosine triphosphate; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a standard Klenow reaction mixture. For competition studies, 100 ng unlabeled, annealed oligomers containing the wild-type (TGTGGT) or mutated (TGTTAG) AML binding site was added into the DNA binding reaction mixtures. For supershift analyses, 1 Î¼g of AML1 antibody was used.  Transcriptional assay  HeLa cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate precipitates containing the luciferase reporter plasmid pM-CSF-R-luc, pcDNA3.1-CBFÎ², and pcDNA3.1-FLAG-tagged AML1 or AML1 mutants expression plasmid. The total amount of plasmid for each transfection was adjusted to 9.25 Î¼g by adding empty expression plasmid. Cells were harvested and lysed 48 hours after transfection, and luciferase assays using a luminometer Fluroskan Ascent (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) were performed by Dual luciferase assay systems (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions. Results of the reporter assays represented the average values for relative luciferase activity generated from 3 independent experiments that were normalized using the activity of pRL-tk (Promega) as an internal control. To analyze functional competitions between wild-type AML1 and mutants, U937 cells were transfected with pM-CSF-R-luc, wild-type AML1, and AML1 mutants expression plasmid using Effectene (Qiagen). Empty plasmid was added to bring the total amount of DNA per transfection to 2.8 Î¼g. Luciferase assays were performed as described above.  Results  High frequency of AML1 mutations in radiation-associated and therapy-related MDS/AML  To investigate the AML1 mutations in radiation-associated and therapy-related MDS/AML, we analyzed exons 3 through 5 (corresponding to amino acid 1 to 177) of the AML1gene by PCR-SSCP assay using genomic DNA extracted from mononuclear cells in the bone marrow of patients. Mutations were further confirmed by sequence analysis of RT-PCR products. AML1 mutations were found in only 2 (2.7%) of 74 sporadic MDS patients, in accordance with previous studies8-11 (Table1). In contrast, AML1mutations were identified in 6 (46%) of 13 MDS cases, who had been within 3 km of the hypocenter of the atomic bomb explosion in Hiroshima (see â€œPatients and methodsâ€�). The frequency of AML1mutations in MDS patients among A-bomb survivors was significantly higher than that in sporadic MDS cases (Pâ€‰&amp;lt;â€‰.0001). The clinical findings of these patients are summarized in Table2. Unlike acute and chronic leukemia patients among A-bomb survivors, only 3 (22%) of 14 MDS patients had been within 1 km of the hypocenter. Two cases had silent mutations (Pro157syn and Thr101syn), 3 cases had missense mutations (Gly42Arg, Asp171Asn, and Gly42Arg), and one case had a frame shift/nonsense mutation (Ser70fsTer93). Of sporadic MDS patients with AML1mutations, one patient (case 7) had a past history of manufacturing a poison gas (mustard gas) during World War II.  View inlineView popup Table 1.

Clinical and cytogenetical features of the MDS patients Next, we analyzed the mutations of therapy-related MDS/AML cases. Missense mutations were found in 2 (33%) of 6 cases (Table3). A refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEBt) patient (case 9) after chemotherapy with mainly alkylating agents and a long period of high-dose radiation therapy for astrocytoma had a missense mutation (Arg177Gln), and the other patient (case 10, Gly138_Arg139insGlyGly), who had been exposed to the A-bomb at a point 4.0 kilometers from the hypocenter, developed AML M0 after intensive multidrug chemotherapy and radiation therapy for B-cell lymphoma.  View inlineView popup Table 3. Clinical features and mutation characteristics of the patients with therapy-related leukemia Finally, of the 7 patients who developed AML after myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) or other hematologic diseases, 3 patients (43%) had missense or nonsense mutations (Table 4). These 3 patients were treated with busulfan, while none of the other 4 patients received this alkylating agent. Case 11, who developed AML after myelofibrosis, had been treated with radiation therapy for splenomegaly. Cases 11 and 12 had had no mutations and chromosomal abnormalities in the chronic phase of MPD. No AML1 mutations were found in 47 MPD and 20 CML patients in the chronic phase.

We observed virtually equal intensities of normal and shifted bands in the PCR-SSCP analysis of all the samples with AML1 mutations and obtained comparable frequencies of normal and mutated results in the sequence analysis. In addition, germ line genomic DNA sequences were examined in specimens from nonleukemic organs from 6 cases (cases 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 12) and found to be normal (data not shown), suggesting that mutations of theAML1 gene were monoallelic at the somatic level. Mutations of the CEBPA gene, which encodes the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein Î± (C/EBPÎ±) were not detected in this study.  Fig. 1.

Abilities of AML1 mutants to bind DNA and to heterodimerize with CBFÎ²  RHD mediates both DNA binding and heterodimerization with CBFÎ². To analyze the DNA binding ability of AML1 mutants, a radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe containing the consensus binding sequence for AML1 and nuclear extracts from Cos-7 cells transfected with AML1 mutants were used in electromobility shift analysis (EMSA). A DNA/protein complex was detected when using nuclear extract from a transfectant expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type AML1 (Figure 2A, lane 2) that was not observed when using an extract from the mock transfectant (lane 1). This complex was supershifted with a specific serum against AML1 (lane 3) and was competed for by the nonradiolabeled oligonucleotide containing AML1 binding site (lane 4), but was not competed for by those containing a mutated AML1 binding site (lane 5), indicating that the complex contains AML1. The complex was not detected using extracts from the transfectants of AML1 mutants that occurred in RHD (lanes 6-8 and 10-13), while the intensity of complex was enhanced using an extract from the transfectant expressing the Gly42Arg mutant (lane 9), indicating that all the AML1 mutants except Gly42Arg lack DNA-binding potential.

The oligonucleotides used as competitors were as follows: â€œWâ€� containing one wild-type AML1 binding site (CGAGTATTGTGGTTAATACG); â€œMâ€� containing one mutated AML1 binding site (CGAGTATTGTTAGTAATACG). (B) Heterodimerization ability of AML1 mutants with CBFÎ². Cos-7 cells were cotransfected with an expression vector containing CBFÎ² cDNA and those containing either wild-type AML1 or mutated AML1 cDNA. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with antiâ€“FLAG M2 antibody, and then proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis (WB) using anti-CBFÎ² antibody (top). The expression levels of CBFÎ² and AML1 in total cell lysates were detected by immunoblot analysis with anti-CBFÎ² antibody (upper middle) and antiâ€“FLAG M2 antibody (lower middle), respectively. The AML1 expression levels also were analyzed by anti-AML1 antibody (bottom). The numbers of AML1 mutants (1-10) are shown in Figure 1. To test whether AML1 mutants are able to interact with CBFÎ², we performed immunoblot analysis after immunoprecipitation. Cos-7 cells were cotransfected the FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutated AML1 (Figure2B, lower 2 panels), together with CBFÎ² (second panel). CBFÎ² was coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged wild-type AML1 by beads coated with anti-FLAG antibody (top panel, lane 3). CBFÎ² also was coimmunoprecipitated with missense AML1 mutants (lanes 7-11), but not with truncated type mutants (lanes 4-6). These results suggested that the loss of the heterodimerization with CBFÎ² depends on a deletion within RHD.  Transcriptional potential of AML1 mutants  To investigate the transcriptional activities of the AML1 mutants, reporter experiments were performed using the promoter of M-CSFR, which is known to be transcriptionally regulated by AML1.26 When wild-type AML1 and CBFÎ² were cotransfected in HeLa cells, the promoter activity was induced 8-fold compared to transfection with CBFÎ² alone (Figure 3A, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, none of the nonsilent mutants except Gly42Arg induced significant trans-activation (lanes 3-10), in accordance with their DNA binding abilities (Figure2A). To examine whether AML1 mutants act as dominant negative inhibitors of wild-type AML1, we performed the same reporter assay using U937 monocytic cells, in which the activity of the M-CSFR promoter was trans-activated by transfecting AML1 alone in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3B). When the truncated type AML1 mutants (mutants 1 to 3) were cotransfected with wild-type AML1, the promoter activities were not affected. In contrast, 4 missense type AML1 mutants (mutants 6, 8, 9, and 10), which lack the DNA-binding ability but retain the potential to bind CBFÎ² (Figure 2A-B), suppressed thetrans-activation activity of wild-type AML1 in a dose-dependent fashion. As expected, the Gly42Arg mutant induced the promoter activity more efficiently than wild-type AML1. Thus, AML1 mutants identified in MDS/AML patients had significantly different effects on the same M-CSFR promoter.  Fig. 3. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Fig. 3.

The expression vector containing wild-type AML1 (0.2 Î¼g) was cotransfected with increasing doses (0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 Î¼g) of expression vectors containing various AML1 mutants. Each value represents the mean of 3 independent experiments. The error bars indicate the mean Â± SD. The numbers of AML1 mutants (1-10) are shown in Figure 1. Discussion  In this paper, we report that AML1 point mutations were detected in virtually half of late-onset MDS patients among the A-bomb survivors of Hiroshima. AML1 was also frequently mutated in MDS/AML patients after treatments that contain alkylating agents and/or local radiation for nonhematopoietic malignancies or MPD. Although we performed PCR-SSCP analysis under optimized conditions, we can&#x27;t exclude the possibility that some mutants were not detectable by our method. Therefore, the actual mutation frequency could be higher.  The incidence of acute and chronic leukemia among A-bomb survivors was sharply dose-dependent, and the leukemia developed after a short latency period. Leukemias appeared after a minimum latency period of 2-3 years, reached a maximum after 6-7 years, and then decreased slowly with time (Figure 4).29 In contrast, the dose-dependency of the risk of other tumors was less prominent, and the incidence of these diseases increased after long minimum latency periods of 10 or more years and continued to increase with time.29 Most of the MDS patients in our study received a low radiation dose judging by their proximity to the hypocenter, as shown in Table 2. Indeed, with the exception of 3 cases, the estimated radiation dose of these patients was below 50 cGy, according to the DS86.22 23 This apparent difference in the distribution of radiation dose between leukemia and late-onset MDS among A-bomb survivors may be interpreted, at least in part, by molecular mechanisms that contribute to the transformation of hematopoietic progenitors. Leukemogenic fusion genes as a result of nonrandom chromosomal translocations are detected in approximately half of acute leukemia patients30 but are relatively rare in MDS cases,31 many of which are generally considered to develop as a result of the accumulation of gene deletions and point mutations.32 Thus, chromosomal translocations caused by double-strand DNA breaks resulting from high dose radiation are likely to contribute to the development of acute and chronic leukemia after a short latency time, whereas point mutations of genes induced by low-dose radiation may contribute to the development of MDS among A-bomb survivors decades later.

Schematic diagram of the incidence of radiation-induced cancer after atomic bombing.Adapted with permission from Kato and Shimizu.29 This idea is supported by a report that investigated â€œinnocentâ€� point mutations in hematopoietic progenitors of healthy A-bomb survivors. Langlois et al33 reported the increased frequency of somatic cell mutations at the glycophorin A (GPA) locus in red blood cells (RBCs) among A-bomb survivors. Although the variant frequencies (VFs) at the GPA locus increased in a dose-dependent fashion among survivors exposed to low-dose exposure (&amp;lt; 1.7 Gy), large fluctuations in VFs were seen for moderate-dose survivors (1.7 to 5 Gy), and VFs were uniformly low for high-dose survivors (&amp;gt; 5 Gy). They interpreted these apparently paradoxical results in terms of the numbers of surviving hematopoietic stem cells, which decrease exponentially with the radiation dose. Because a low-dose exposure of 50 cGy would produce minimal cell kill and induce a VF of around 10â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’6, the number of stem-cell mutations per A-bomb survivor would be 10 to 100, while an exposure of 8 Gy would reduce the stem-cell pool to about 102-103 cells, so that even with an expected VF of 200â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’6 no mutation would be recorded in most individuals. Importantly, the ratio of RBCs harboring the GPA mutations in each individual did not increase with time.34 In contrast, almost all of the bone marrow cells in MDS patients in our study harbored AML1 mutations, judging by the intensity of normal and shifted bands in SSCP analysis, suggesting that the cells expressing mutated AML1 obtained a growth advantage and ultimately occupied the space for hematopoiesis.  A question may be raised that if the MDS patients among A-bomb survivors in this study acquired their AML1 mutations at the time of exposure, then 50 years is too long to develop MDS. The pedigrees of FPD/AML may provide the answer.11 12 AML is mainly an adult-onset disease in FPD/AML patients, suggesting that the accumulation of additional gene alterations required to transform hematopoietic progenitors takes decades, even though all stem cells of FPD/AML patients harbor AML1 gene mutation. Thus, it is not surprising that one stem cell that acquired AML1 mutation took a half century to develop MDS.  Alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors are 2 major drugs that would induce distinctive therapy-related MDS/AML (t-MDS/AML). Patients who develop AML after exposure to alkylating agents mostly have long latency periods, and AML is often preceded by a myelodysplastic phase. Deletion or loss of chromosome 5 or 7,35 as well as mutations of genes such as p53, are frequently observed.36 In contrast, AML cases after exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors typically have a short latency time without prior MDS and harbor balanced translocations involving chromosome bands 3q26, 11q23, and 21q22.35 All t-MDS/AML patients in our study who had an AML1 mutation were treated with alkylating agents, with or without local radiation, and had relatively long latency periods (range, 60-182 months; median, 123 months) without chromosomal translocations, suggesting that there is a close relation between AML1 mutation and t-MDS/AML associated with alkylating agents, although further large studies are necessary to confirm this. Also, it remains to be established whether AML1 mutations in t-AML secondary to MPD were induced in normal hematopoietic progenitors by alkylating agents or were acquired in abnormal progenitors as a second hit during the progression from preleukemic phase to overt leukemia.  The crystal structure of the runt domain-CBFÎ²-DNA ternary complex has been determined recently and provides a structural basis for the effects of human disease-associated mutations on the biologic function of the AML1 protein.13-16 DNA binding is mediated by 3 loops called loop(Î²A&#x27;-B), loop(Î²E&#x27;-F), and C-terminal tail in the runt domain, and the amino acid residues (Arg80, Lys83, Thr84, Arg135, Arg139, Gly141, Arg142, Gly143, Ile168, Thr169, Val170, Asp171, Arg174, and Arg177) that directly contact the DNA were determined. Half of these residues (Arg80, Lys83, Arg135, Arg139, Asp171, Arg174, and Arg177) were found to be the targets of amino acid replacement by missense mutations in de novo MDS/AML and/or FPD/AML pedigrees in previous reports. Conversely, all missense mutations, with one exception (His58Asn, discussed below), that were identified in previous papers were mapped to these 3 loops, and biochemical data for these mutants, as well as for truncated type mutations as a result of frame shift, demonstrated the lack of DNA binding potential.8 9 11 13 14 In contrast, amino acid residues in domains responsible for binding CBFÎ², which are distinct from those involved in DNA binding, were never reported to be mutated in MDS/AML. In our study, all missense mutations but one (Gly42Arg) also occurred in the 3 loops responsible for DNA binding and were associated with a loss of DNA binding ability (Table 5 and Figure 2A), indicating that AML1 mutations associated with low-dose radiation and alkylating agents, as well as in de novo MDS/AML and FPD/AML, contribute to the transformation of hematopoietic progenitors by altering the DNA binding potential of this critical transcription factor in hematopoiesis.  View inlineView popup Table 5. Summary of mutations found in this study Although almost all the missense and truncated-type mutants of AML1 in the previous reports and in this paper lose DNA binding potential, and thus lack the trans-activation activity when tested by reporter assay using the M-CSFR promoter (Figure 3A), the missense mutations down-regulated the trans-activation potential of wild-type AML1 in a dominant-negative fashion, while the truncated-type mutations have no such effect (Figure 3B). This difference is important, because normal AML1 protein is expected to be expressed in MDS/AML cells because the normal allele for AML1 gene is usually retained. On the other hand, 2 missense mutations, His58Asn and Gly42Arg, bind DNA even more avidly than wild-type AML1 and enhance thetrans-activation potential of normal AML1 (Osato et al8 and Figure 3B). These somewhat puzzling findings could be explained by the choice of promoter in the reporter assay, because M-CSFR is unlikely to be the true target gene of AML1 mutants in the transformation process of hematopoietic progenitors. Alternatively, subtle dysregulation of the trans-activation activity of AML1, even up-regulation or down-regulation, might provide a growth advantage to hematopoietic cells. In this regard, 2 silent mutations (Thr101syn, Pro157syn) identified in this study would have pathologic significance. Although they may most simply be taken to represent a polymorphism, we did not find any other silent mutations among more than 300 samples. Thus, we assumed that these mutations might somehow affect the expression levels of AML1 protein through a posttranscriptional mechanism.  Because no mutations were detected in the C-terminal portion of AML1 (amino acid 178 to 453) in previous studies,8 11 we initially limited our SSCP analysis to the RHD. However, if subtle alteration of AML1 function could result in leukemogenic potential, mutations may exist also in the C-terminal portion that mediatestrans-activating potential. Indeed, a substantial number of nonsense or insertion/deletion mutations were found in the C-terminal portion (amino acid 215 to 507) of AML3/RUNX2/CBFA1, another member of the Runx transcription factor family that shares the RHD, in patients with a hereditary bone disease, cleidocranial dysplasia, which is caused by mutation of AML3 mainly in the RHD (Otto et al37). Thus, we extended our efforts to detect mutations in the C-terminal portion of AML1 in AML/MDS patients. We found a few patients with insertion/deletion mutants that resulted in frameshift mutations, although no mutations were found in A-bomb survivors (data not shown). Careful functional analysis of mutations in theAML1 gene should be performed to clarify these unsolved questions using in vitro and in vivo experimental systems. To develop the latter, mice carrying mutated AML1 genes are currently being established in our laboratory.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;The RUNX gene family includes three evolutionarily conserved genes (RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3) encoding transcription factors involved in cell lineage differentiation during development and various forms of cancer. The RUNX1 gene, located in chromosome 21q22, is crucial for the establishment of definite hematopoiesis and the generation of hematopoietic stem cells in the embryo. It contains a â€œRunt homology domainâ€� (RHD) and a transactivation domain. RUNX1 can act as activator or repressor of target gene expression depending upon the large number of transcription factors, coactivators and corepressors that interact with it. Three modes of leukemogenesis due to acquired alterations of the RUNX1 gene have been recognized: point mutations, amplification and translocations. Some translocations have been shown to be recurrent whereas others have been only reported in a few cases or in a sole case. At present, 32 partner chromosomes have been described but the partner gene has solely been identified in 17 translocations at the molecular level. Most of the translocations involving RUNX1 lead to the formation of a fusion transcript made of the 5â€² region of RUNX1, including the RHD, fused to the 3â€² region of a partner gene, with the exception of RUNX1-ETV6 in which the 3â€² sequences of RUNX1, including the RHD, are fused to the 5â€² region of ETV6, including its promotor. Three RUNX1 translocations (retaining RHD) that are fused out of frame to partner genes are also known. All the translocations that retain RHD but remove the transcription activation domain have a leukemogenic effect by acting as dominant negative inhibitors of wild-type RUNX1 in transcription activation.  RUNX1 fusion gene translocation acute leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome gene transcription review Previous Section Next Section RUNX Gene Family and the RUNX1 Gene  The RUNX gene family includes three evolutionarily conserved genes (RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3) encoding transcription factors involved in cell lineage differentiation during development and various forms of cancer (1). RUNX1 gene, located in chromosome 21q22.3, is crucial for the establishment of definite hematopoiesis and the generation of hematopoietic stem cells in the embryo, RUNX2, located in chromosome 6p21, is essential for osteogenesis and RUNX3, located in chromosome 1p36.1, plays a major role in neurogenesis and thymopoiesis (2, 3).  Members of this family share a 128 amino acids region of high sequence homology, called â€œRunt domainâ€�, first identified in the Drosophila runt gene. In addition to this â€œRunt homology domainâ€� (RHD), there is a 5 amino acid sequence, VWRPY, that is 100% conserved at the C-terminal end of each of the three gene products (2). The Runt domain is responsible for heterodimerization with the core-binding factor Î² (CBFÎ² or PEBP2Î²) to form a transcription factor and for DNA binding (4).  The Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) gene, also known as AML1, CBFA2 and PEBP2Î±B, spans 260 kb and consists of 12 exons with two distinct promoters, each followed by the initiation codon ATG. These two promoters, which are 160 kb apart, generate several alternatively spliced mRNAs differing in their types of 5â€² and 3â€² UTRs (untranslated regions) and their coding regions. Although at least 12 different RUNX1 mRNAs are generated, two splice variants are well-characterized. The distal promotor-driven transcript, RUNX1b, encodes a 480 amino acid protein and the proximal promotor-driven transcript, RUNX1c, a 453 amino acid protein. The Runt homology domain is retained in both transcripts (2, 5-7). The full-length coding regions harbor the carboxy-terminal half of the protein which regulates transcription (including the transcription activation and inhibition domains) (8).  Figure 1.

Distribution of the chromosomal arm partners of translocations involving RUNX1. â–  Recurrent translocations with known partner gene; â—� Rare translocation with known partner gene; â–´ Rare translocation with unknown partner gene.  RUNX1 acts as a key regulator of hematopoiesis through the regulation of various hematopoietic genes, including growth factors (GM-CSF, MPO, IL3), surface receptors (TCRA, TCRB, M-CSF receptor, FLT3), signaling molecules (CDKN1A, BLK, BCL2), and transcription activators (STAT3, MYB) (1,9). RUNX1-regulated target genes are essential for definite hematopoiesis of all lineages (10).  RUNX1 can act as activator or repressor of target gene expression depending upon the large number of transcription factors, co-activators and co-repressors that interact with it. RUNX1 functions as an organizing protein that facilitates assembly of transcriptional activation or repression complexes. By recruitment of non-DNA binding proteins as p300/CBP and HAT (histone acetyltransferase), it contributes to activate transcription of target genes. Upon recruitment of non-DNA binding repressors as mSin3A, Groucho/TLE and HDAC (histone deacetylase), it represses transcription of target genes (11, 12).  Previous Section Next Section RUNX1 Deregulation  RUNX1 deregulation can be the result of constitutive gene abnormalities. Germ-line point mutations and haploin-sufficiency of the RUNX1 gene causes an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by familial thrombocytopenia and propensity to develop acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) (13-15). The incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia is much higher among Down syndrome patients who are also at an increased risk of developing acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AML-M7). It is hypothesized that increased RUNX1 gene dosage is relevant to the high incidence of these hematological diseases in children with constitutive trisomy 21 (16).  Three modes of leukemogenesis due to acquired alterations of the RUNX1 gene have been recognized. Point mutations are most frequently found in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) M0 subtype, in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and subsequent leukemia, and in therapy-related MDS/AML (6, 17). RUNX1 amplification can occur through polysomy of chromosome 21 or true amplification. The amplification could be the result of intrachromosomal amplification by tandem repeat or the presence of multiple copies on double minutes, ring and marker chromosomes (17-20). Its role in leukemogenesis is still unknown but RUNX1 amplification induces gene over-expression and could contribute to transformation of hematopoietic cells (21). Perturbation in RUNX1 function can also be the result of chromosomal translocations.  View this table: In this window In a new window Table I. Chromosomal translocations involving the RUNX1 gene.  Previous Section Next Section RUNX1 Translocations  Some translocations involving RUNX1 have been shown to be recurrent whereas others have been only reported in a few cases or in a sole case (Figure 1). At present, 32 partner chromosomes have been described but the partner gene has solely been identified in 17 translocations at the molecular level (Table I).  Seven partner genes are known to be involved in recurrent translocations (Table I). The t(8;21)(q22;q22), first described by Rowley in 1993 (22), was shown to involve the ETO (MTG8) gene in the early 1990s (23-25). The RUNX1-ETO fusion gene is identified in some 30% of the patients with AML-M2 subtype. In the RUNX1-ETO translocation product, the transactivation domain of RUNX1, which normally binds the transcriptional coactivators p300-CBP, is replaced by almost the entire ETO. As a consequence, the fusion protein recruits a co-repressor complex involving NCoR, mSin3A, SMRT and HDACs instead of the co-activators p300-CBP. Therefore, the RUNX1-ETO transcript functions as transcriptional repressor of genes normally activated by RUNX1 (26-28).  First described by Raimondi et al. in 1989 in a case of AML subtype M1 (29), the t(16;21)(q24;q22) has now been reported in 16 patients, including 12 with AML-M2, eleven patients having had chemotherapy for a previous cancer (30, 61). This translocation was subsequently shown to induce the formation of a new chimeric gene involving the RUNX1 and MTG16 (Myeloid Translocation Gene on chromosome 16) genes, the latter belonging to the ETO gene family (31). The significant homology between MGT16 and ETO suggests that both RUNX1-MTG16 and RUNX1-ETO fusion genes have similar activity (32). The RUNX1-MTG16 protein is an altered transcriptional co-repressor capable of recruiting histone deacetylases, thus repressing the expression of RUNX1 target genes (33).  The t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation is a recurrent rearrangement observed in patients with de novo or therapy-related AML, therapy-related MDS and chronic myeloid leukemia in blastic phase. Three genes have now been shown to fuse with RUNX1. These are EAP, EVI1 and MDS1 (27, 34-37).  The RUNX1-EAP transcript includes the RHD of RUNX1 and the last 96 codons of EAP. The fusion mRNA is terminated by an out-of-frame stop codon shortly after the junction between RUNX1 and EAP (27, 34, 38, 39, 60). It is likely that the RUNX1-EAP protein acts as a constitutive repressor inhibiting the function of the normal RUNX1.  The RUNX1-EVI1 transcript includes the RHD of RUNX1 and the two zinc-finger clusters of EVI1. As a consequence, RUNX1-EVI1 exerts a dominant negative effect over the wild-type RUNX1 in transcription activation, an anti-apoptotic effect (due to the first zinc-finger domain) and a proliferation stimulation effect (due to the second zinc-finger domain) (40). RUNX1-MDS1/EVI1 is a chimeric in-frame fusion gene of the RUNX1 and MDS1/EVI1 genes (34, 35, 41, 59) that interferes with RUNX1 functions in a dominant negative manner, but shares some biological effects with EVI1.  The t(1;21)(p36;q22) translocation is a rare, but recurrent, translocation associated with therapy-related AML/MDS (42-45). It results in a RUNX1-PRDM16 fusion gene which retains the RHD of RUNX1 and almost the entire PRDM16 (44, 45). The RUNX1-PRDM16 gene sharing extensive homology with RUNX1-EVI1, it is likely that the RUNX1-PRDM16 protein acts in a similar way as has been shown for the RUNX1-EVI1 protein (45).  The t(12;21)(p13;q22) is the most common structural chromosomal abnormality in pediatric common or B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, accounting for some 25% of the cases (46, 47). At the molecular level, this translocation fuses the 3â€² region of RUNX1 and the 5â€² region of ETV6 (TEL) (48, 49). The ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene retains the RHD and the transcription activation domain of RUNX1 as well as the promoter and the central repression domain of ETV6. The ETV6-RUNX1 fusion protein retains the ability to bind the RUNX1 target sequences and has the potential to function as a HDAC-dependent repressor, causing deregulation of the RUNX1 target genes (50).  Ten other partner genes have been identified in rare translocations (42, 51-56, 58, 62-63) (Table I). Several transcripts have been characterized. Two RUNX1 translocations (retaining RHD) are fused out of frame to partner genes; these are RUNX1-CPNE8 [t(12;21)(q12;q22)] (51) and RUNX1-AMP19 [t(19;21)(q13;q22)] (52). In the other transcripts that have been characterized, the 5â€² region of RUNX1, including the RHD, is fused to the 3â€² region of the partner gene (53-58), with the exception of the RUNX1-ZNF687 transcript which induces the lack of RHD and transcription activation domain (53). In this case, this would prevent CBFB binding and transcriptional activation of target genes involved in hematopoietic differentiation.  Seventeen translocations involving the RUNX1 gene and a yet unknown partner gene have also been described (42-43,64-68) (Table I).  Previous Section Next Section Conclusion  In conclusion, most of the translocations involving RUNX1 lead to the formation of a fusion transcript made of the 5â€² region of RUNX1, including the RHD, fused to the 3â€² region of a partner gene, with the exception of RUNX1-ETV6 in which the 3â€² sequences of RUNX1, including the RHD, are fused to the 5â€² region of ETV6, including its promotor. Three RUNX1 translocations (retaining RHD) that are fused out of frame to partner genes are also known. All the translocations that retain RHD but remove the transcription activation domain have a leukemogenic effect by acting as dominant negative inhibitors of wild-type RUNX1 in transcription activation.  The Runt-related transcription factor 1 gene (RUNX1 aliases AML1, CBFA2 and PEBP2aB) belongs to a family of three evolutionarily conserved genes (RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3) that code for transcription factors involved in cell lineage differentiation during development [1,2]. The RUNX1 gene, located in chromosome 21q22.3, is crucial for the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis and the generation of hematopoietic stem cells in the embryo [1,3,4]. RUNX2, located in chromosome 6p21, is essential for osteogenesis and RUNX3, located in chromosome 1p36.1, plays a major role in neurogenesis and thymopoiesis [5,6]. Members of this family share a 128-amino acid region of high sequence homology, known as the â€˜Runt domainâ€™, first identified in the Drosophila runt gene. In addition to this â€˜Runt homology domainâ€™ (RHD), there is a 5-amino acid sequence, VWRPY, that is 100% conserved at the C-terminal end of each of the three gene products [5]. The Runt domain is responsible for heterodimerization with the core-binding factor-b (CBF-b or PEBP2b), to form a transcription factor, and for DNA binding [7]. The RUNX1 gene spans 260 kb and consists of 12 exons with two distinct promoters, each followed by the initiation codon ATG. The RUNX1 protein is composed of 453 amino acids and contains several regions of major importance (Figure 1) [2]. These are the RHDs coded by exons 3â€“5 and located in the N-terminal part (amino acids 50â€“177), the transcription activation domain (TAD; amino acids 243â€“371) coded by part of exon 7 and exon 8, the transcription inhibition domain (amino acids 372â€“411) and the VWRPY sequence. All three are located in the C-terminal region [8â€“12]. The two promoters, which are 160 kb apart, generate several alternatively spliced mRNAs differing in their types of 5Â´ and 3Â´ untranslated regions (UTRs) and their coding regions. Although at least 12 different RUNX1 mRNAs are generated, two splice variants are well characterized. The distal promotor-driven transcript, RUNX1b, codes for a 480-amino acid protein and the proximal promotor-driven transcript, RUNX1c, a 453-amino acid protein. The RHD is retained in both transcripts [5,13â€“15]. The fulllength coding regions harbor the C-terminal half of the protein, which regulates transcription [16]. A third splice variant, RUNX1a, codes for a protein that retains the RHD but lacks the TAD. This protein has a higher affinity for DNA binding and suppresses transcriptional activation of RUNX1b [17]. RUNX1 acts as a key regulator of hematopoiesis through the regulation of various hematopoietic genes, including growth factors (GM-CSF, MPO and IL-3), surface receptors (TCRA, TCRB, M-CSF receptor and FLT3), signaling molecules (CDKN1A, BLK and BCL2) and transcription activators (STAT3 and MYB) [2,18,19]. The RUNX1 protein acts as an activator or repressor of target gene expression depending upon the large number of transcription factors, coactivators and corepressors that interact with it. RUNX1 functions as an organizing protein that facilitates assembly of transcriptional activation or repression complexes (Figure 2). By recruitment of non-DNA binding proteins as p300/CBP and histone acetyltransferase (HAT), it contributes to the activation of transcription of target genes. Upon recruitment of non-DNA binding repressors such as mSin3A, Groucho/TLE and histone deacetylase (HDAC), it represses transcription of target genes [20â€“24]. RUNX1 translocations Some translocations involving RUNX1 have been shown to be frequent while others have only been reported in a few or single cases (Figure 3). At present, 55 partner chromosome bands have been described, but the partner gene has only been identified in 21 translocations at the molecular level (Table 1). Five translocations are known to be frequent in malignant hemopathies. They involve six different partner genes. The t(1;21)(p36;q22) translocation is a rare but recurrent translocation associated with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplasia (AML/MDS) [25â€“28]. It results in a RUNX1â€“PRDM16 (PR domain containing 16) fusion gene. The t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation is a recurrent rearrangement observed in patients with de novo or therapy-related AML, therapyrelated MDS and chronic myeloid leukemia in the blastic phase. This translocation is very often included in a complex karyotype and the prognosis is poor. Three genes have now been shown to fuse with RUNX1. These are RPL22L1 (alias EAP, ribosomal protein L22-like 1) and MECOM (MDS1 and EVI1 complex locus, previously known as MDS1 and EVI1 [ectropic viral integration site 1]) [29â€“34]. The t(8;21)(q22;q22), first described by Rowley in 1973 [35], was shown to involve the RUNX1T1 (aliases ETO, MTG8) gene in the early 1990s [36â€“38]. The RUNX1â€“RUNX1T1 fusion gene is identified in some 30% of the patients with AML-M2 subtype and is frequently associated with other cytogenetic abnormalities. Complete remission is achieved in the majority of patients, but relapse usually occurs within a few years [34,39,40]. The t(12;21)(p13;q22) is the most common structural chromosomal abnormality in pediatric common, or B-cell acute, lymphoblastic leukemia, accounting for approximately 20â€“25% of the cases. Complete remission is achieved in almost all the patients and the prognosis is very good, although late relapse is possible [41â€“43]. At the molecular level, this translocation fuses the 5Â´ region of ETV6 (alias TEL) with almost the entire coding region of RUNX1 [44,45]. First described by Raimondi et al. in 1989 in a case of AML subtype M1 [46], the t(16;21) (q24;q22) has now been reported in 20 patients, including 12 with AML-M2, 11 patients having had chemotherapy for a previous cancer [47,48]. This translocation was shown to induce the formation of a new chimeric gene involving the RUNX1 and CBFA2T3 (alias MTG16, core-binding factor, Runt domain, a subunit 2 translocated to 3) genes. There were 16 other partner genes or sequences identified in translocations associated with one or a few cases of malignant hemopathies (Table 1). The fusion genes that were characterized will be described elsewhere. A total of 33 translocations were also seldom reported (Table 2). In all these translocations, the RUNX1 gene was shown to be disrupted, presumably leading to the fusion of the RUNX1 gene with an as yet unidentified gene partner. However, in a few cases, these translocations involve a break point located in a band in which a partner gene has already been identified. This is true, for example, for translocations involving bands 1q21, 4q31 and 19q13. Whether these translocations involve an already known partner gene, or a different gene, remains to be determined. Unusual &amp;amp; complex rearrangements involving the RUNX1 gene Complex translocations involving three or four chromosomes and insertions have been reported in fewer than 100 cases (Table 3). All but two of the translocations in which both genes were identified, lead to the formation of a RUNX1â€“RUNX1T1 or a RUNX1â€“ETV6 fusion gene. Complex variant t(8;21) translocations have been reported in 6â€“10% of cases with RUNX1â€“RUNX1T1 fusion gene, the remaining patients having the classic t(8;21)(q22;q22) [40,49]. Compilation of six studies, totaling 214 patients with RUNX1â€“RUNX1T1 identified by real-time PCR (RT-PCR), real-time quantitative PCR or RNA-based PCR, demonstrates that 196 patients (91.6%) have the usual t(8;21)(q22;q22) whereas the remaining 18 patients (8.4%) have an unusual or complex rearrangement [50â€“55]. Among these latter patients, nine (4.2% of the 214 patients) have a three-way translocation, two (0.9%) a four-way translocation and seven (3.3%) an insertion. A literature search allowed us to retrieve 54 complex translocations involving the RUNX1 gene and band 8q22 (Table 3). The involvement of the RUNX1T1 gene was not searched for in ten cases; it was assumed that these translocations were variant t(8;21) translocations. Still, one cannot exclude the possibility that another gene located in band 8q22 was fused to RUNX1 (as we will see for band 3q26 elsewhere), or that the fusion occurred between a gene located on the third chromosome and RUNX1. The RUNX1â€“RUNX1T1 fusion gene was identified in the remaining 44 translocations. There were 38 three-way and six four-way translocations. Most of the three-way translocations could be recognized by conventional cytogenetics. However, in a few patients, the t(8;21) variants were â€˜maskedâ€™ as they appeared to involve chromosome 8 and a chromosome other than chromosome 21. However, in these cases, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), using dual-color AML1/ETO probe and/or RT-PCR, confirmed the involvement of both genes and the formation of a fusion gene [56â€“59]. All the chromosomes except chromosomes 7, 18, 22 and Y have been involved in complex translocations. Most of them were involved more than once, chromosomes 10 and 13 having been identified in five translocations each and chromosomes 1, 2 and 12 in four translocations each. However, even among these chromosomes, no band was found to be nonrandomly broken. In three-way translocations, up to three fusion genes can theoretically be generated, one fusing the 5Â´ region of RUNX1 with the 3Â´ region of RUNX1T1, the second fusing the 5Â´ region of RUNX1T1 with the 3Â´ part of another gene and the third fusing the 5Â´ part of this other gene with the 3Â´ region of RUNX1. Whether generation of these other fusion genes is associated with a more aggressive disease among patients with three-way translocation than those with the classic t(8;21) remains to be elucidated. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, no group has tried to identify these other fusion genes. However, one cannot exclude that some apparently complex translocations could be the result of two or more consecutive translocations. In such cases a standard RUNX1â€“RUNX1T1 fusion gene would be created, whereas the subsequent translocation(s) would involve loci close to, but different from, the RUNX1 and RUNX1T1 genes. A total of 15 chromosomal fragment insertions leading to RUNX1â€“RUNX1T1 fusion were also retrieved from the literature (Table 3). This includes the insertion of chromosome 21 material (including portions of the RUNX1 gene) into band 8q22 (six patients), or vice versa, the insertion of chromosomal material (including portions of RUNX1T1) into band 21q22 (nine patients). All the insertions of material from chromosome 21 into chromosome 8 were cryptic, although one was suspected on G-banded metaphases [51]. Some of the insertions of chromosome 8 material into chromosome 21 were identified by conventional cytogenetics because they involved larger chromosomal fragments [50,60,61]. Complex translocations involving chromosomes 12, 21 and another chromosome have been rarely reported [201]. In only three of them (two three-way and one four-way translocations), FISH using dual-color TEL-AML1 probe and/or RT-PCR confirmed the presence of the fusion gene [62â€“64]. Insertion is even rarer, only one case of insertion of 21q22 in band 12p13 with formation of the RUNX1â€“ETV6 fusion gene having been reported (Table 3) [65]. Structure &amp;amp; function of the fusion genes The fusion genes can be classified into five categories according to their structure and, as a consequence, to their function (Table 4). In addition, the same translocation can lead to different fusion products acting through different mechanisms. Indeed, alternate splicing transcripts have been reported in many fusion genes involving RUNX1, leading to in-frame fusion products with or without others leading to out-of-frame fusion products [27,66â€“73]. Furthermore, most studies have focused on the consequences of the chimeric proteins on the transcriptional activity of RUNX1, but few have analyzed the contributions of the fusion partners to leukemogenesis. However, there is now strong evidence that RUNX1 and its partner could cooperate to contribute to leukemogenesis using different pathways involving, for example, GATA and RAS [71,74,75]. Most of the chimeric genes involving RUNX1 fuse the 5Â´ part of the gene with the 3Â´ part of the partner gene. The RHD, located in the 5Â´ region of RUNX1, is retained in these fusion genes, but not the TAD situated in the 3Â´ part of the gene (Table 4). Several translocations also lead to truncated fusion genes retaining the RHD but not the TAD of RUNX1. These truncated RUNX1 gene products may compete with wildtype RUNX1 and act as dominant constitutive repressors inhibiting the function of the normal RUNX1 (Table 4). The RUNX1â€“PRDM16 fusion gene, obtained as the result of the t(1;21)(p36;q22) translocation, retains the RHD of RUNX1 and almost the entire PRDM16 gene [27,28]. Since the RUNX1â€“PRDM16 gene shares extensive homology with RUNX1â€“MECOM, it is likely that the RUNX1â€“PRDM16 protein acts in a similar way, as has been shown for the RUNX1â€“MECOM protein [28]. The translocation also generates a truncated RUNX1 transcript containing RHD [27,28]. The t(1;21)(p35â€“36.1;q22) translocation, described in a 68 year-old male with AML by Nguyen et al., leads to the formation of a RUNX1â€“YTHDF2 (YTH domain family member 2) transcript that includes the RHD, but not the TAD of RUNX1 [75]. The breakpoint occurs in intron 5 of the YTHDF2 gene that has six exons but is only translated from exons 1 to 5. Therefore, the fusion protein has a truncated RUNX1 protein without translating YTHDF2. The t(1;21)(q21;q22) translocation generates an in-frame chimeric RUNX1â€“ZNF687 (zinc finger protein 687) gene with the breakpoint located in intron 3 of the RUNX1 gene [75]. As a result, the fusion protein retains the first 57 amino acids of RUNX1, but only the first seven amino acids of the RHD, leading to a truncated and, presumably, nonfunctional RHD. This would prevent CBF-b and DNA binding and transcriptional activation of target genes involved in hematopoietic differentiation. Cytogenetic analysis of leukemic cells of a patient with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia revealed a t(2;21)(q13;q22) translocation. Molecular analysis revealed three RUNX1â€“AFF3 (alias LAF4, AF4/FMR2 family member) fusion transcripts, one in-frame, one out-of frame and one showing premature termination due to the insertion of an intronic sequence [76]. The breakpoints occurred in intron 7 of RUNX1 and all three retained the RHD. The t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation leads to the formation of, among others, a RUNX1- MECOM transcript that includes the RHD of RUNX1 and the two zinc-finger clusters of MECOM. The chimeric protein can accumulate PEBP2b in the nucleus more efficiently than the wild-type RUNX1, a mechanism contributing to leukemogenesis [77]. As a consequence, RUNX1â€“MECOM exerts a dominant negative effect over the wild-type RUNX1 in transcription activation, an antiapoptotic effect (owing to the first zinc-finger domain) and a proliferation stimulation effect (owing to the second zinc-finger domain) [29,31,78â€“80]. The RUNX1â€“RPL22L1 transcript, resulting from the t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation, includes the RHD of RUNX1 and the last 96 codons of RPL22L1. The fusion mRNA is terminated by an out-of-frame stop codon shortly after the junction between RUNX1 and RPL22L1 [29,30,81,82]. It is likely that the RUNX1â€“RPL22L1 protein acts as a negative inhibitor of the RUNX1 protein. The t(4;21)(q28;q22) translocation fuses the 5Â´ region of the RUNX1 gene (breakpoint in intron 6) to a 27 codon sequence of a novel gene named FGA7 (fused gene 7 to AML1) [69]. This rearrangement leads to a stop codon in the chimeric gene, resulting in a truncated RUNX1 protein possessing the RHD domain, but not the TAD. The t(4;21)(q31;q22) translocation, identified in one patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia, leads to the formation of an in-frame RUNX1â€“SH3D19 (Src homology 3 domain protein 19, also known as EEN-binding protein) transcript that includes the RHD of the RUNX1 gene and the full-length coding sequence of the SH3D19 gene [75]. The cryptic t(7;21)(p22;q22) translocation leads to the formation of a RUNX1â€“USP42 fusion gene that includes the RHD, part of the TAD of RUNX1 and almost the entire open-reading frame (except exon 1) of USP42 (ubiquitinspecific protease 42) gene. Unlike the other chimeric genes in which the breakpoint occurs 5Â´ to the TAD, in the RUNX1â€“USP42 fusion gene it occurs within the TAD; however, it is most likely nonfunctional because it is disrupted [72]. In the RUNX1â€“RUNX1T1 protein product generated by the t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation, the TAD of RUNX1, which normally binds the transcriptional coactivators p300-CBP, is replaced by almost the entire RUNX1T1. As a consequence, the fusion protein recruits a corepressor complex involving N-CoR, mSin3A, SMRT and HDACs instead of the coactivators p300-CBP. Therefore, the RUNX1â€“RUNX1T1 transcript functions as a transcriptional repressor of genes normally activated by RUNX1 [30,83â€“86]. Furthermore, genes, such as TIS11b (alias ERF-1), under the downstream control of the fusion protein are overexpressed and contribute to leukemogenesis [87]. The t(8;21)(q24;q22) translocation generates an in-frame chimeric gene that encodes a protein made of the N-terminal portion of RUNX1 (retaining the RHD) and the entire TRPS1. The TRPS1 (tricho-rhino-pharyngeal syndrome type I) gene encodes a nuclear transcription factor with ten zinc finger domains, including a GATA-type zinc finger [71]. Agerstam et al. described a t(9;21)(q34;q22) that generated a chimeric gene made of the first four exons of RUNX1 and repetitive sequences of a gene with unknown function. As a result, the fusion protein contained a truncated RHD and 70 amino acids from chromosome 9 ending with a stop codon [88]. Therefore, this truncated RUNX1 protein may compete with wild-type RUNX1 and act as a dominant constitutive repressor inhibiting the function of the normal RUNX1. The t(11;21)(q12;q22) translocation generates two in-frame chimeric transcripts from alternate splicing that encode proteins made of the N-terminal portion of RUNX1 (retaining the RHD) and the C-terminal of LPXN (leupaxin), a member of the paxillin superfamily of adaptor proteins [73]. LPXN is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells and negatively regulates B-cell receptor signaling [89,90]. Out-of-frame fusions, in which the RHD of RUNX1 is retained but an early stop codon occurs in the LPXN gene, are also generated. Two RUNX1-MACROD1 (alias LRP16, MACRO domain containing 1) fusion genes owing to alternate splicing were identified following molecular analysis of a t(11;21) (q13;q22) translocation [91]. Both retain the RHD of RUNX1 and the full-length coding sequence, but include exon 1 of MACROD1, a gene for which the precise biological function remains to be elucidated. At the molecular level, the t(12;21)(p13;q22) translocation fuses the 5Â´ region of ETV6 and the 3Â´ region of RUNX1 [44,45]. The ETV6â€“RUNX1 fusion gene retains the RHD and the TAD of RUNX1 as well as the promoter and the central repression domain of ETV6. The ETV6â€“RUNX1 fusion protein retains the ability to bind the RUNX1 target sequences and has the potential to function as a HDAC-dependent repressor, causing deregulation of the RUNX1 target genes [22,92,93]. Molecular analysis of a t(12;21)(q12;q22) translocation revealed an out-of-frame fusion of RUNX1 with the CPNE8 (Copine VIII) gene, resulting in translational termination after two amino acids of Copine VIII and, thus, a truncated RUNX1 protein. This truncated protein contained the RHD but not the TAD, the breakpoint having occurred in intron 6 of the RUNX1 gene [94]. The significant homology between CBFA2T3, fused to RUNX1 in the t(16;21)(q24;q22) translocation, and RUNX1T1 suggests that both RUNX1-CBFA2T3 and RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion genes have similar activity [68,95]. The RUNX1-CBFA2T3 protein is an altered transcriptional corepressor capable of recruitingThe t(19;21)(q13;q22) translocation fuses the 5Â´ end of the RUNX1 gene (breakpoint in intron 6) to a 236 nucleotide sequence on chromosome 19 termed AMP-19 [97]. This rearrangement leads to an out-of-frame fusion gene, resulting in a truncated RUNX1 protein bearing the RHD domain, but not the TAD. The rare t(X;21)(p22;q22) translocation leads to the formation of an in-frame RUNX1- PRDX4 transcript that includes the RHD of the RUNX1 gene. The PRDX4 gene, a member of the peroxiredoxin family, has a peroxidase activity, but is also involved in other cellular functions, including cell proliferation and differentiation [70]. Chan et al. described a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome associated with a t(X;21) (p22.3;q22) identified in conventional cytogenetics that was demonstrated, by FISH and molecular studies, to be a three-way translocation, t(X;8;21)(p22;q23;q22), leading to a RUNX1â€“ZFPM2 fusion gene [74]. The ZFPM2 gene (zinc finger protein, multitype 2, alias FOG2, friend of GATA-2) encodes a protein that retains the RHD of RUNX1 and the zinc fingers that interact with GATA proteins and the CtBP (corepressor C-terminal binding protein) interaction domain of ZFPM2. Two patients presenting with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia associated with a cryptic inv(21)(q21q22) were found to have a USP16- RUNX1 fusion transcript. In both cases, the transcript did not have an open reading frame and was made of the 3Â´ part of the USP16 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 16) gene and the 5Â´ part of RUNX1. Furthermore, the RHD coded by exons 3 to 5 of the RUNX1 gene is not preserved in the fusion protein [98]. Identification of two new partners of the RUNX1 gene Bone marrow and/or peripheral blood of patients with myeloid leukemia referred to the cytogenetics laboratory of the University Hospital in Brest are usually analyzed by FISH using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones in search of fusion genes involving the RUNX1 gene. This approach allowed us to identify a new partner gene in one case and to demonstrate in another case the complexity of rearrangements involving band 3q26 in which three RUNX1 partners have already been identified [99]. Analysis of a t(20;21)(q13;q22) Conventional cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood cell culture of a woman with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, identified a 47,XX,+8 karyotype in seven of the 19 cells studied. However, FISH analysis using the dual-color TEL-AML1 probe (Abbott, Rungis, France) showed disruption of the AML1 probe and localization of part of it on a small chromosome. As abnormalities of chromosome 20 are recurrently observed in CMML, 20p and 20q subtelomeric probes (Abbott) were applied. The analysis showed the 20q subtelomere to be translocated to the long arm of chromosome 21, signing the presence of a cryptic translocation involving bands 20q13 and 21q22, t(20;21)(q13;q22). Further FISH analyses were performed with BAC clones located on 20q and a clone (RP11â€“77G18) covering the RUNX1 gene [202]. Clones RP11â€“184L6 and RP11â€“135L8, normally located in band 20q13.2, were found to be split by the breakpoint. Hybridization with RP11â€“184L6 and RP11â€“77G18 showed colocalization of both signals, as the result of a probable fusion gene. BAC clones RP11â€“184L6 and RP11â€“135L8 contain the ZFP64 (zinc finger protein 64 homolog) gene; the protein coded by this gene could be involved in transcription regulation. Sakamoto et al. showed that the ZFP64 protein interacted with the intracellular domain of NOTCH1, a signaling protein having a major role in mesenchymal cell differentiation [100]. Furthermore, the expression of ZFP64 is under the control of RUNX2, belonging to the same gene family. Analysis of a t(3;21)(q26;q22) A complex translocation involving five chromosomes, which included both chromosomes 3, t(3;11;22;21;3)(p13;q14;q12;q22;q26), was identified in the bone marrow cells of a 51-yearold patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia without maturation (AML-M1, FAB classifi ca- FAB classification) at relapse following bone marrow trans- at relapse following bone marrow transplantation [99]. FISH analysis using the dualcolor TEL-AML1 probe showed disruption of the AML1 probe and translocation of part of it on chromosome 3, in band 3q26. Further FISH analyses were performed with BAC clones located on 3q26, some of them covering the MECOM complex locus and RPL22L1 gene already known to be fused with RUNX1 in (3;21) translocations, and a clone (RP11â€“77G18) covering the RUNX1 gene. In this case, the breakpoint occurred between clones RP11â€“434P20 and RP11â€“245C23 at 3q26, eight megabases distal to the MECOMRPL22L1 cluster, therefore arguing for the involvement of another gene. Three genes have been mapped in this interval between RP11â€“434P20 and RP11â€“245C23, including WIG1, a wild-type p53-induced gene [203]. This gene could be a good candidate to fuse with RUNX1 as it is located in the nucleus and contains three zinc finger domains and a putative nuclear localization signal. Unfortunately, no remaining material was available for further cytogenetic and molecular studies. This case illustrates the importance of always identifying the partner gene even when RUNX1 is involved in a â€˜recurrent translocation with known partner geneâ€™. Conclusion Most of the translocations involving RUNX1 lead to the formation of a fusion transcript made of the 5Â´ region of RUNX1, including the RHD but not the TAD, fused to the 3Â´ region of a partner gene, the breakpoints being concentrated in introns 5 and 6 of the RUNX1 gene (Figure 4). One exception is the RUNX1- ETV6 fusion gene, in which the 3Â´ sequences of RUNX1, including RHD and TAD, are fused to the 5Â´ region of ETV6, including its promotor. All the translocations that retain RHD but remove TAD have a leukemogenic effect by acting as dominant negative inhibitors of wild-type RUNX1 in transcription activation, mimicking the normal, but rare, RUNX1a splice variant which has higher affinity for DNA binding and suppresses the transcriptional activation of RUNX1b. Future perspective Given the crucial role of RUNX1 for the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis and generation of hematopoietic stem cells, it is expected that future studies will try to better understand its implication in normal hematopoiesis. Thus, this will provide more data on the leukemogenic effects of fusion genes involving RUNX1 and, possibly, give useful information on the phenotypic heterogeneity of leukemia associated with RUNX1 abnormalities. Much will be learned when currently unidentified genes are discovered, putting more insight into the mechanisms by which these partner genes and RUNX1 may cooperate in contributing to leukemogenesis using several different pathways. HDACs, thus repressing the expression of RUNX1 target genes [96].

It produces a chimeric protein, acute myeloid leukemia-1 (AML-1)â€“eight-twenty-one (ETO), that contains the amino-terminal DNA binding domain of the AML-1 transcriptional regulator fused to nearly all of ETO. Here we demonstrate that ETO interacts with the nuclear receptor corepressor N-CoR, the mSin3 corepressors, and histone deacetylases. Endogenous ETO also cosediments on sucrose gradients with mSin3A, N-CoR, and histone deacetylases, suggesting that it is a component of one or more corepressor complexes. Deletion mutagenesis indicates that ETO interacts with mSin3A independently of its association with N-CoR. Single amino acid mutations that impair the ability of ETO to interact with the central portion of N-CoR affect the ability of the t(8;21) fusion protein to repress transcription. Finally, AML-1/ETO associates with histone deacetylase activity and a histone deacetylase inhibitor impairs the ability of the fusion protein to repress transcription. Thus, t(8;21) fuses a component of a corepressor complex to AML-1 to repress transcription.  The gene for acute myeloid leukemia-1 (AML-1) is one of the most frequently translocated genes in human cancer. It is targeted by t(8;21) and t(3;21) in AML and by t(12;21) in acute lymphocytic leukemia (39). AML-1 is also indirectly targeted by inv(16), which disrupts core binding factor beta, an AML-1-interacting protein. AML-1 binds the enhancer core motif (TGT/cGGT) and regulates a variety of viral and cellular genes in concert with other factors (31). t(8;21) is one of the most frequent translocations found in AML, comprising 10 to 15% of cases with discernible translocations (39). The t(8;21) fusion protein AML-1/ETO acts as a repressor of transcription in transient-transfection assays (10, 31, 32, 43). When expressed during development, the t(8;21) fusion protein yielded the same phenotype as AML-1 deficiency (37, 45).  Although eight-twenty-one (ETO; also known as MTG8 [myeloid tumor gene 8] [8, 34]) was identified at the breakpoint of t(8;21), little is known about the normal function of the protein. ETO is the human homologue of the Drosophila Nervy protein (9), and it shares four homologous domains with the Nervy protein. These include a region with extensive homology to a Drosophila coactivator, transcription-activating factor 110 (TAF110), a predicted hydrophobic heptad repeat (HHR), a small domain with no other homology, termed the Nervy domain (27), and the MYND (myeloidâ€“Nervyâ€“DEAF-1 [12]) domain. The MYND domain is present in numerous human, murine, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila proteins and contains two putative zinc finger (ZF) motifs (9, 12, 31). ETO is expressed in hematopoietic cells and in the brain, but another closely related family member is ubiquitously expressed (19). A third closely related factor, MTG16, is fused to AML-1 by t(16;21) (20).  AML-1 is a site-specific DNA binding protein that can both activate and repress transcription (2, 28, 36). The t(8;21) fusion protein AML-1/ETO contains the N-terminal 177 amino acids of AML-1, including the DNA binding domain, fused to nearly all of ETO (7, 8, 34). The fusion protein inhibits AML-1-dependent transactivation (10, 32). AML-1/ETO also repressed both basal transcription and Ets-1-dependent activation of the multidrug resistance 1 promoter (27). Similarly, AML-1/ETO inhibited both AML-1 and C/EBPÎ±-dependent transactivation of the neutrophil protein 3 (NP-3) promoter (44). AML-1/ETO-mediated repression is dependent on both the DNA binding domain of AML-1 and ETO sequences (24). AML-1/ETO acts at substoichiometric levels and thus does not compete with AML-1 for DNA binding sites within promoters, nor does it act to â€œsquelchâ€� transcription (24). Thus, we hypothesized that ETO recruits a corepressor or normally functions as a corepressor to inhibit transcription (30, 31, 33).  Several corepressor proteins have been recently described that associate with histone deacetylases (HDACs) to repress transcription (3, 5, 13, 17, 38, 40, 42). The nuclear hormone corepressor N-CoR was identified through interactions with the thyroid hormone receptor and associates with mSin3 proteins and HDACs (16, 17). N-CoR and the related protein SMRT are released from nuclear hormone receptors upon ligand binding, allowing transcriptional activation (5, 16, 22, 35).  Here we demonstrate that ETO associates with corepressors. ETO physically interacts with N-CoR, mSin3A, and HDACs and resides in cells as a component of large protein complexes. Deletion of the domains of ETO that are homologous to Nervy indicate that mSin3A can bind ETO independently of N-CoR. AML-1/ETO also associates with these corepressors and with HDAC activity. Single amino acid substitutions in the MYND domain that affect the ability of ETO to interact with the central portion of N-CoR impair AML-1/ETO-mediated repression of the NP-3 promoter. Finally, an HDAC inhibitor impairs AML-1/ETO-mediated repression. Thus, t(8;21) fuses the DNA binding domain of AML-1 to a putative corepressor, ETO.  Go to: MATERIALS AND METHODS Yeast two-hybrid assays. ETO residues 1 to 604 were subcloned in frame with GAL4 residues 1 to 147 in the pASII vector. Human N-CoR residues 1019 to 2061 linked to the transcriptional activation domain of GAL4 was isolated previously (18), and this plasmid was cotransformed with pASII-ETO into yeast strains PJ69-4A and Y190. Protein interactions in strains PJ69-4A were measured by growth on adenine-deficient media (Fig. â€‹(Fig.1B1B and C) and by growth on histidine-deficient media containing 2 mM 3-aminotriazole. Interactions in strain Y190 were measured by growth on histidine deficient media in the presence of 50 mM aminotriazole. Deletion and point mutations in ETO have been described previously (27).  FIG. 1 FIG. 1 ETO interacts with N-CoR. (A) Schematic diagram of the GAL4â€“N-CoR, GAL4-ETO, and GAL4-ETO deletion mutant fusion proteins used in the yeast two-hybrid interaction system. Although a fragment of the human N-CoR cDNA was used in these assays, the ... Glutathione agarose precipitation assays. N-CoR was transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and cysteine (PROMIX; Amersham) by using the T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in accordance with the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. For precipitation assays, equal amounts of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were incubated with 25 Î¼l of the N-CoR in vitro transcription-and-translation reaction mixture in 200 Î¼l of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After 1 h at 4Â°C, the beads were washed three times with PBSâ€“0.5% Triton X-100 and resuspended in 2Ã— sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer, and proteins were separated by SDSâ€“8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) prior to autoradiography.  Cell culture. C33A and Cos-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (BioWhittaker Inc., Walkersville, Md.) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50-U/ml penicillin, 50-Î¼g/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM l-glutamine (all from BioWhittaker). Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker) containing 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and l-glutamine. NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium containing 10% calf serum.  Coimmunoprecipitations, sucrose gradient sedimentation, and immunoblotting. Cos-7 cells (3 Ã— 106/100-mm-diameter dish) were cotransfected by using Lipofectamine (Bethesda Research Laboratories) with 3.5 Î¼g of plasmid CMX-NCOR (Flag epitope tagged) (16) and 1.5 Î¼g of plasmid CMV5-ETO (32), or cells were transfected with 4 Î¼g of each plasmid individually. For endogenous proteins, 5 Ã— 106 HEL cells were extracted with PBS supplemented with 1 mM EDTA, 1.5-mg/ml iodoacetamide, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1-trypsin IU/ml aprotinin, and 0.5% Triton X-100 unless otherwise noted. Lysates were sonicated and incubated with 100 Î¼l of formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus (Pansorb; CalBiochem) for 30 min to remove nonspecific protein binding. After centrifugation for 5 min at 4Â°C, the supernatants were collected and immunoprecipitated for 1 h with an affinity-purified primary antibody (K-20 anti-mSin3A or C-19 anti-HDAC-2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-HDAC-1 has already been described [23]). A 15-Î¼l volume of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) was then added, the mixture was incubated for 30 min to collect the immune complexes, and the immune complexes were then washed three times at 4Â°C with lysis buffer. A 100-Î¼g sample of protein (quantitated with the Bio-Rad DC protein assay) or the immune complexes were boiled in Laemmli buffer for 2 min, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% milk and incubated with the indicated primary antibody overnight at 4Â°C. Proteins were visualized by ECL (Pierce).  Sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis was performed by lysing HEL cells in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1 mM EDTA. Cell lysates were separated by centrifugation at 28,000 rpm for 15 h in an SW50 rotor. Sedimentation standards (Bio-Rad broad-range markers supplemented with ferritin and thyroglobulin) were analyzed on parallel gradients. Fractions (250 Î¼l) were collected, and 40 Î¼l of each fraction was analyzed by SDSâ€“8% PAGE. Immunoblot analysis was sequentially performed with ETO, mSin3A, and HDAC-1 antibodies. The upper portion of the blot was independently probed with N-CoR antibodies.  HDAC assays. Cells were lysed in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors, and immunoprecipitations were performed as described above. Immune complexes were resuspended in 20 mM Tris [pH 8]â€“150 mM NaClâ€“10% glycerol and assayed for HDAC activity by using [3H]acetate-labeled chicken erythrocytes as previously described (16).  Transcription assays. C33A cells were transfected with 5 Î¼g of an NP-3-137-Luciferase plasmid, 1 Î¼g of a pCMV5-AML-1B plasmid, 0.5 Î¼g of an MSV-C/EBPÎ± plasmid, 1 Î¼g of a Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (LTR)-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmid, and 10 Î¼g of the indicated pCMV5-AML-1/ETO plasmid (44) (Fig. â€‹(Fig.11 and reference 28 contain details of the mutations). Luciferase activity was measured as previously described (44) and normalized to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity, which was quantitated by using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen) with 1 Î¼g of WWP-Luciferase (p21Waf1/Cip1 [6]), 2 Î¼g of pCMV5-AML-1/ETO and 1 Î¼g of the Rous sarcoma virus LTR-renilla luciferase plasmid. Firefly and renilla luciferase activities were measured by using the Duel Luciferase Assay System (Promega).  Go to: RESULTS ETO interacts with N-CoR. Our transcriptional analysis of the t(8;21) fusion protein indicated that AML-1/ETO repressed transcription by recruiting a corepressor. Therefore, we adopted a candidate gene approach to test whether known corepressors could physically interact with ETO in a yeast two-hybrid assay. ETO was fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain and tested for interaction with a chimeric protein containing the central portion of N-CoR fused to the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain (the latter was obtained in a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins interacting with the repressor BCL-6 [18]) (Fig. â€‹(Fig.1A).1A). In this assay, interaction of the two proteins generates a functional activator capable of inducing the Ade2 and His3 reporter genes. As measured by growth on adenine-deficient media (Fig. â€‹(Fig.1B1B and â€‹and1C)1C) and growth on histidine-deficient media containing 3-aminotriazole (data not shown), the nuclear hormone corepressor N-CoR interacted with ETO.  We next determined which of the conserved domains in ETO are required for N-CoR interaction (Fig. â€‹(Fig.1B1B and C). Deletion of the MYND motif, but not the other conserved domains, eliminated the ability of ETO to interact with N-CoR. Moreover, the MYND domain alone fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain associated with N-CoR (Fig. â€‹(Fig.1B1B and C).  The MYND domain contains two predicted zinc finger motifs (Fig. â€‹(Fig.2A).2A). When either of these putative motifs was disrupted by small deletions, the ETOâ€“N-CoR interaction was lost (Fig. â€‹(Fig.2B2B and C). Furthermore, serine substitutions of either of two conserved cysteine residues within the putative ZF motifs also abrogated the ETOâ€“N-CoR interaction (Fig. â€‹(Fig.2B2B and C), indicating that these ZF motifs act together to form a protein interaction domain.  FIG. 2 FIG. 2 N-CoR interacts with the ZFs of the MYND domain. (A) Schematic diagram of the GAL4-ETO fusion protein. The amino acid sequence of the MYND domain of ETO is shown. Conserved cysteine and histidine residues that form the predicted ZF motifs are indicated ... To determine whether the MYND domain was sufficient for interaction with full-length N-CoR, we tested whether a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal one-third of ETO, including the MYND domain, could associate with N-CoR synthesized in vitro. As shown in Fig. â€‹Fig.3A,3A, the C-terminal 212 amino acids of ETO fused to GST bound significantly more N-CoR that did GST alone.  FIG. 3 FIG. 3 ETO interacts with N-CoR in vitro and in mammalian cells. (A) ETO interacts with N-CoR in vitro. GST and GST-ETO containing the C-terminal 283 residues of ETO were linked to glutathione agarose beads and used to purify in vitro-transcribed and -translated ... To demonstrate that ETO and N-CoR interact in mammalian cells, we coexpressed ETO and Flag epitope-tagged N-CoR in Cos-7 cells and measured their association by using immunoprecipitation assays. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated by using anti-Flag antibodies, and N-CoR and ETO were detected by immunoblot analysis using antibodies directed against the Flag epitope and the C terminus of ETO (Fig. â€‹(Fig.3B).3B). ETO was coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibodies only when Flagâ€“N-CoR was coexpressed, indicating a specific physical interaction.  Endogenous ETO coimmunoprecipitates with mSin3A. N-CoR interacts with mSin3 proteins and HDACs to repress transcription (1, 14, 16, 23, 35, 47). Therefore, we investigated whether endogenous ETO also associates with these proteins. HEL cells express easily detectable levels of ETO protein (27); therefore, we immunoprecipitated HEL cell extracts with mSin3A antibodies and determined whether ETO was a component of mSin3A complexes by using immunoblot analysis (Fig. â€‹(Fig.4A).4A). A significant proportion of the ETO in HEL cells coimmunoprecipitated with mSin3A antibodies (Fig. â€‹(Fig.4A).4A). Lesser amounts of protein coimmunoprecipitated with mSin3B antibodies (data not shown). This could be because of lower levels of mSin3B in these cells or because the antibodies to mSin3B were directed against PAH2 and this domain may not be accessible in the complex. The ETO-mSin3A complex remained intact when the cells were lysed in PBS containing both 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS but was dissociated when cell lysates were prepared with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% SDS (Fig. â€‹(Fig.4B4B and C). As an additional control, we added the mSin3A antigenic peptide prior to immunoprecipitation, and this peptide eliminated the coprecipitation of ETO with mSin3A (Fig. â€‹(Fig.4D).4D).  FIG. 4 FIG. 4 Endogenous ETO associates with mSin3A. (A) HEL cell extracts were analyzed directly, or 25-fold more extract was immunoprecipitated with mSin3A antibodies and then subjected to immunoblot analysis by using antibodies to ETO. C33A cells express undetectable ... Our anti-ETO serum is directed to the C terminus of ETO, which contains the MYND domain. We were unable to coprecipitate mSin3A by using this serum, likely because the epitope is obscured when ETO is in protein complexes. Therefore, we created a Flag-tagged ETO cDNA and investigated whether this protein could coimmunoprecipitate endogenous mSin3A. As shown in Fig. â€‹Fig.4E,4E, mSin3A was precipitated with anti-Flag antibodies only when Flag-ETO was expressed, indicating a specific association between mSin3A and ETO.  Endogenous ETO interacts with endogenous HDAC-2. Both N-CoR and mSin3A act as corepressors by linking site-specific DNA binding proteins to HDACs (1, 14, 16, 23, 35, 47). Therefore, we investigated whether ETO associates with HDAC-1 or HDAC-2. ETO was transiently expressed in Cos-7 cells, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HDAC-1 antibodies prior to immunoblot analysis with anti-ETO immunoglobulin G (IgG). ETO copurified with HDAC-1, and addition of the HDAC-1 antigenic peptide eliminated the association of ETO with HDAC-1 (Fig. â€‹(Fig.5A).5A). The association was not observed under conditions of higher stringency (1% Triton X-100â€“0.1% SDS; data not shown). Thus, either the ETOâ€“HDAC-1 interaction is relatively weak or the association is indirect and is mediated by mSin3A or N-CoR. Similarly, transiently expressed ETO was detected in HDAC-2 immune complexes (Fig. â€‹(Fig.5B).5B). However, in contrast to that with HDAC-1, the association of ETO with HDAC-2 was stable under more stringent conditions.  FIG. 5 FIG. 5 ETO interacts with HDACs. (A) ETO interacts with endogenous HDAC-1. Cos-7 cells were transfected with pCMV5-ETO, and cell extracts were prepared in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and immunoprecipitated with anti-HDAC-1 IgG in the presence or ... Given the association of overexpressed ETO with endogenous HDAC-1 and HDAC-2, we investigated whether endogenous ETO interacts with either of these enzymes. HEL cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to the HDACs, and the immune complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of ETO. From HEL cells, ETO coimmunoprecipitated with HDAC-2 (Fig. â€‹(Fig.5C)5C) but not HDAC-1 (negative data not shown). Because HDAC-1 can associate with transiently expressed ETO (Fig. â€‹(Fig.5A),5A), this may suggest that the levels of HDAC-1 are too low in HEL cells for detection in this assay, that the antisera have different affinities, or that in HEL cells ETO preferentially associates with HDAC-2.  ETO interacts with mSin3A in the absence of N-CoR binding. The MYND of ETO interacts with the central portion of N-CoR (Fig. â€‹(Fig.1),1), but other regions of ETO could also associate with N-CoR. When mutant ETO proteins lacking each of the domains conserved with Nervy were tested for N-CoR interaction in vivo, these proteins, including a deletion of the MYND domain, still bound to N-CoR (negative data not shown; Fig. â€‹Fig.11 contains a schematic diagram of these mutant proteins). Therefore, we expressed an ETO protein lacking both the Nervy and MYND (ZF) domains and a mutant protein lacking the HHR, Nervy, and MYND (ZF) domains and tested these mutant proteins for interaction with mSin3A (Fig. â€‹(Fig.6A)6A) and N-CoR (Fig. â€‹(Fig.6B).6B). By comparison to wild-type ETO, somewhat less of the Nervy/MYND mutant bound to N-CoR (Fig. â€‹(Fig.6B).6B). The further deletion of the HHR motif greatly reduced the affinity of ETO for N-CoR. Given that the MYND domain interacts with the central portion of N-CoR in yeast two-hybrid assays, these results suggest a second interaction domain between ETO and N-CoR, outside of residues 1019 to 2061 of N-CoR. By contrast, the mSin3A association was not impaired by the deletion of the individual conserved domains (data not shown) or by the combined deletion of the HHR, Nervy, and MYND domains (Fig. â€‹(Fig.6A).6A). Thus, mSin3A can bind ETO independently of N-CoR. Moreover, this result indicates that N-CoR does not bind ETO through the mSin3A-ETO interaction.  FIG. 6 FIG. 6 ETO contacts mSin3A independently of N-CoR. The indicated ETO mutants were expressed in Cos-7 cells and tested for the ability to coimmunoprecipitate with mSin3A (A) or N-CoR (B) as described in the legends to Fig. â€‹Fig.33 and â€‹and4.4. Cell ... ETO cosediments with mSin3A and N-CoR. N-CoR and mSin3A have been suggested to be components of a large complex containing HDACs and other associated proteins (1, 14, 16, 23, 35, 47). Therefore, we tested whether endogenous ETO is a component of a high-molecular-weight complex. HEL cell lysates were prepared in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and fractionated over a 10 to 30% sucrose gradient. By comparison to standards separated on parallel gradients, ETO, N-CoR, mSin3A, and HDAC-1 cosedimented with an apparent molecular mass of 300 to 600 kDa (Fig. â€‹(Fig.7).7). As well, mSin3A and HDAC-1 were found in fractions corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of greater than 600 kDa. The apparent size of the ETO-containing complex is much larger than the expected size of free ETO, ETO dimers, or ETOâ€“N-CoR and ETO-mSin3A heterodimers. Coupled with the physical association of ETO with mSin3A and N-CoR, we propose that endogenous ETO is a component of one or more corepressor complexes.  FIG. 7 FIG. 7 Endogenous ETO cosediments with mSin3A and N-CoR. HEL cell lysates (2 mg of total protein) were fractionated on a 10 to 30% sucrose gradient. A 40-Î¼l sample of each fraction was separated on an 8% polyacrylamide gel and then subjected ... AML-1/ETO interacts with corepressors. Cell lines containing t(8;21) are difficult to culture, likely due to the ability of the fusion protein to inhibit the cell cycle-promoting activities of AML-1 (41). To determine whether the t(8;21) fusion protein associates with corepressors, we transiently expressed the AML-1/ETO fusion protein in Cos-7 cells, immunoprecipitated mSin3A or HDAC-1, and detected coimmunoprecipitating AML-1/ETO by immunoblot analysis. The fusion protein copurified with both mSin3A (Fig. â€‹(Fig.8A)8A) and HDAC-1 (Fig. â€‹(Fig.8B).8B). Similar results were obtained with antibodies directed to HDAC-2 (data not shown). Finally, AML-1/ETO was coimmunoprecipitated with Flag antibodies when AML-1/ETO was cotransfected with Flag-tagged N-CoR (Fig. â€‹(Fig.8C).8C). Thus, as expected, AML-1/ETO associates with the same corepressors as does wild-type ETO.  FIG. 8 FIG. 8 The t(8;21) fusion protein interacts with mSin3A, HDAC-1, and N-CoR. (A) AML-1/ETO coimmunoprecipitates with anti-mSin3A IgG. AML-1/ETO was transfected into Cos-7 cells, and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with mSin3A antibodies in PBS containing ... ETO and AML-1/ETO associate with HDAC activity. To determine whether ETO and AML-1/ETO associate with HDAC activity, we transiently expressed hemagglutinin (HA)-ETO in 293 cells or Flagâ€“AML-1/ETO in Cos-7 cells, immunoprecipitated it with anti-HA or anti-Flag antibodies, and measured the associated HDAC activity. The HA antibodies immunoprecipitated HDAC activity only when ETO was expressed (Fig. â€‹(Fig.9A).9A). Likewise, the anti-Flag antibodies immunoprecipitated HDAC activity only when Flagâ€“AML-1/ETO was expressed (Fig. â€‹(Fig.9B).9B). This level of activity was greater than that observed for Max dimerization (MAD) (Fig. â€‹(Fig.9B),9B), which served as a positive control in this assay. Similar results were obtained for AML-1/ETO in 293 cells (Fig. â€‹(Fig.9C).9C). Thus, ETO and AML-1/ETO interact with corepressor complexes containing active HDAC.  FIG. 9 FIG. 9 ETO and AML-ETO are associated with HDAC activity. (A) L293 cells were transfected with an HA-tagged ETO expression plasmid, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies or with normal rabbit serum (NRS). (B) Cos-7 or L293 (C) cells ... AML-1/ETO domains that are required for repression of AML-1B- and C/EBPÎ±-dependent transactivation. The C-terminal 283 amino acids of ETO are required for transcriptional interference with AML-1B (the largest transcriptionally active isoform of AML-1 [32]) and for inhibition of C/EBPÎ± and Ets-1 transactivation (24, 27, 44). To test the role of N-CoR interactions in repression, we transferred the ETO deletions depicted in Fig. â€‹Fig.11 into AML-1/ETO (27) and tested these mutant proteins for the ability to repress the transactivation of the differentiation-specific NP-3 promoter. NP-3 transcription was activated over 50-fold by a combination of AML-1B and C/EBPÎ±. The ability of wild-type AML-1/ETO and deletion mutant AML-1/ETO to inhibit this activation was assessed by using luciferase activity as a reporter. As demonstrated previously (44), AML-1/ETO efficiently blocked AML-1B-C/EBPÎ± synergistic activation (Fig. â€‹(Fig.10A).10A). Deletion of the TAF110 homology domain and the Nervy domain had little or no effect, but deletion of either the MYND domain or the HHR motif significantly impaired AML-1/ETO-mediated repression. Deletion of both the HHR motif and the MYND domain completely inactivated AML-1/ETO. Finally, the single amino acid changes that are predicted to disrupt the putative ZF motifs in the MYND domain and which eliminate the ETOâ€“N-CoR interaction in yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. â€‹(Fig.2)2) significantly impaired transcriptional repression (Fig. â€‹(Fig.10B).10B). Given that deletion of the MYND domain did not ablate the association of ETO with N-CoR or mSin3A in mammalian cells, it appears that specific contacts between the MYND domain and N-CoR are required for repression.  FIG. 10 FIG. 10 AML-1/ETO-mediated repression cosegregates with the ability to interact with the central domain of N-CoR. The rat NP-3 promoter was activated approximately 50- to 60-fold by a combination of AML-1B and C/EBPÎ± and repression by AML-1/ETO, and the ... An HDAC inhibitor affects AML-1/ETO-mediated repression of the p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter. Because transcriptionally impaired forms of AML-1/ETO still bind mSin3A and N-CoR, we sought to determine the role of HDACs in AML-1/ETO-mediated repression by using trichostatin A (TSA), an HDAC inhibitor. In NIH 3T3 cells, the NP-3 promoter was affected by TSA and could not be used for this analysis. However, we have previously demonstrated that the p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter (Fig. â€‹(Fig.11A)11A) is a transcriptional target of AML-1 (28) and that the p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter was not activated by 300 nM TSA in NIH 3T3 cells (28). Therefore, we determined the effect of TSA on AML-1/ETO-mediated repression of the p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter. Cells were transiently transfected, and TSA was added to the culture media immediately after transfection. AML-1/ETO inhibited expression from the p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter by 5.6-fold, and the addition of TSA reduced repression by nearly 60% (Fig. â€‹(Fig.11B).11B). Taken together with the physical association of the t(8;21) fusion protein with mSin3A, N-CoR, HDAC-1, and HDAC-2 (Fig. â€‹(Fig.8)8) and the association of AML-1/ETO with HDAC activity (Fig. â€‹(Fig.9),9), this result confirms the role of HDACs in AML-1/ETO-mediated repression. Moreover, we have recently demonstrated that TSA inactivates AML-1/ETO in a biological assay (41).  FIG. 11 FIG. 11 An HDAC inhibitor impairs AML-1/ETO-mediated repression of the p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter. (A) Schematic diagram of the p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter. Open boxes represent perfect matches for the AML-1 consensus binding site, and dark boxes represent 5-of-6-bp matches ... Go to: DISCUSSION Analysis of the transcriptional regulatory activity of the t(8;21) fusion protein led us to propose that AML-1/ETO interacts with a corepressor (24, 32). We have demonstrated that in mammalian cells, ETO associates with N-CoR, mSin3A, and HDACs. We have demonstrated that N-CoR interacts with ETO in yeast two-hybrid assays, in vitro, and in mammalian cells. ETO deletion mutants that have lost the ability to interact with N-CoR still bind mSin3A, indicating that N-CoR does not associate with ETO through mSin3A. Thus, the cumulative evidence suggests that the N-CoR interaction with ETO is direct. As well, the interaction of endogenous ETO with endogenous mSin3A under stringent conditions and the association of mSin3A with AML-1/ETO mutants that fail to bind N-CoR suggest that this interaction is also direct. However, these data do not preclude the possibility that an unidentified protein (that is conserved from yeast to humans) mediates the association of ETO and these corepressors. Based on the association of endogenous ETO with endogenous mSin3A at high stoichiometry and the observation that ETO is found only in high-molecular-weight complexes by sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis, we propose that ETO is a component of one or more complexes containing mSin3A, N-CoR, and HDACs in vivo.  The four domains of ETO that are conserved in its Drosophila homologue Nervy appear to be protein interaction motifs (e.g., the HHR [27] and MYND [Fig. 1] regions). We have been unable to demonstrate that wild-type ETO binds DNA cellulose or that it binds DNA specifically (28). Therefore, we propose that ETO functions in a corepressor complex as an adapter protein, perhaps linking N-CoR, mSin3, and other proteins. These interactions could occur within the complex, for instance, to stabilize N-CoR/mSin3A complexes, or ETO may link the corepressors to site-specific DNA binding proteins to regulate transcription. In the latter case, ETO would be analogous to the retinoblastoma protein, which represses transcription by linking an HDAC complex to DNA binding proteins (4, 26, 29). t(8;21) takes advantage of this activity to create an AML-1 repressor by fusing the DNA binding domain of AML-1 to ETO.  The MYND domain of ETO interacts with the central portion of N-CoR, including repression domain 3, in yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. â€‹(Fig.11 and â€‹and2).2). However, when the MYND domain was deleted, the mutant ETO retained the ability to interact with both N-CoR and mSin3A in mammalian cells. This result suggests the presence of a second N-CoR binding domain on ETO. Moreover, because an ETO protein lacking the HHR, Nervy, and MYND domains retained the ability to interact with mSin3A, we conclude that mSin3A can bind ETO in the absence of an ETOâ€“N-CoR interaction. Because deletion of the TAF110 domain also did not affect mSin3A interactions (data not shown), mSin3A may contact ETO through more than one domain or the interaction site may be outside of the conserved domains. However, deletion of the MYND and HHR domains did impair the ability of the fusion protein to repress transcription. Therefore, the interaction of the fusion protein with mSin3A and/or N-CoR is not sufficient for repression, and specific interactions, such as the MYND domain contacting the central portion of N-CoR, may be required for full activity.  Although AML-1/ETO represses the transcription of most of the promoters tested, in two cases, transactivation has been observed. AML-1/ETO synergized with wild-type AML-1 to activate the M-CSF1 receptor promoter (46). Because the cooperativity was mediated by a single AML-1 binding site, it was proposed that the fusion protein was acting indirectly, perhaps by titrating a corepressor, to active transcription (46). Our current results are consistent with this interpretation. In the second report, AML-1/ETO was demonstrated to activate transcription of the BCL-2 promoter through an AML-1 binding site that resides within a negative regulatory region of the promoter (21). While AML-1/ETO appears to strongly bind mSin3A, N-CoR, and HDACs, we cannot rule out the possibility that the fusion protein also can act to activate transcription through an undefined mechanism.  The observation that AML-1/ETO functions by interacting with an HDAC-containing complex(es) may also have therapeutic implications. In acute promyelocytic leukemia, t(11;17) and t(15;17) target the gene for retinoic acid receptor alpha. Both of these translocation fusion proteins interact with the N-CoR and SMRT corepressors and use HDACs to inhibit transcription. Leukemic blasts or cell lines containing t(15;17) differentiate in response to all-trans-retinoic acid, but cells expressing the t(11;17) fusion protein differentiated only when all-trans-retinoic acid was supplemented with the HDAC inhibitors (11, 15, 25). Recently, we have observed that high-level expression of AML-1/ETO disrupts normal cell cycle control in hematopoietic cells. TSA completely ablated AML-1/ETO function in this biological system (41). The association of t(8;21) with N-CoR, mSin3 corepressors, and HDACs, coupled with the ability of TSA to transcriptionally impair AML-1/ETO (Fig. â€‹(Fig.11),11), indicates that HDAC inhibitors may have more general application for chemotherapeutic intervention in acute myeloid leukemia.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;Introduction  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal stem-cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and susceptibility to leukemic transformation (MDS/acute myelogenous leukemia [AML]). Progression from MDS-refractory anemia with excess blasts (MDS-RAEB) to AML is frequently observed in the clinical course, which is thought to result from serial acquisition of cytogenetic abnormalities.1â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“5 According to the 2-hit model of leukemogenesis, one class of mutations (class I), including FLT3-ITD, N-Ras, or K-Ras mutations, confers on cells a proliferative advantage; a second class of mutations (class II), including AML1/ETO, PML/RARÎ±, or MLL-related fusion genes, interferes with hematopoietic differentiation.6 Indeed, it has been reported that a combination of class I and II mutations such as FLT3-ITD plus AML1-ETO or MLL-SEPT6 induced AML in a mouse bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model, while either class I or II mutations alone led to, if anything, myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), not leukemia.6â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“13 On the other hand, the precise molecular mechanism underlying development of MDS and MDS/AML remains elusive partly because there are only a few mouse models for MDS and MDS/AML available. So far, 2 distinct models of MDS have been reported: Evi1 induced MDS-like symptoms in a mouse BMT model in which the mice succumbed to fatal peripheral cytopenia,14 while NUP98-HOXD13 transgenic mice developed MDS and died of either various types of acute leukemia or severe anemia and leukocytopenia.15 In the present study, we generated a mouse BMT model of MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML induced by AML1 mutants frequently found in patients with MDS and MDS/AML. Interestingly, the phenotypes of these mice very much resemble those of the human diseases.  The AML1 gene is located on chromosome 21q22 and is the most frequent target for chromosomal translocation in leukemia. Analysis of AML1-deficient mice has shown that AML1 is indispensable for the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis.16â‡“â€“18 As accumulated studies have demonstrated, heterozygous germline mutations in the AML1 gene caused familial platelet disorder with predisposition to AML (FPD/AML),19,20 and sporadic point mutations were frequently found in the development of leukemia: 21% of AML M0, 15.0% to 15.9% of MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML, and 46% of radiation-associated MDS.21â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“29 The vast majority of AML1 mutations were located in the Runt homology domain (RHD), which mediated its ability to bind to DNA and core-binding factor Î² (CBFÎ²). To confirm the involvement of AML1 mutations in hematopoietic disorders, we selected 2 types of AML1 mutants found in patients with MDS/AML: one with a point mutation in RHD (AML1-D171N), and the other with C-terminal truncation caused by a frame-shift (AML1-S291fsX300). After transplantation using bone marrow cells infected with retrovirus vectors harboring AML1 mutants, most of the mice that received transplants died of MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML. Long-term analysis demonstrated that the phenotype of the mice that underwent transplantation depended on the kind of AML1 mutants used in this study and on the integration sites of retroviruses. Considering the recent reports of the effects of retrovirus integration sites on biological results,30â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“38 identification of integration sites may lead to the discovery of the genes involved in the induction of MDS/AML in concert with AML1 mutants. Intriguingly, the enhanced expression of Evi1 by retrovirus integration seemed to collaborate with AML1-D171N to induce MDS/AML with the same phenotype. Moreover, we confirmed that combination of AML1-D171N and Evi1 induced AML of the same phenotype with shorter latencies in the mouse BMT model. This model will allow valuable insight into the molecular pathogenesis of MDS and MDS/AML.  Methods  Vector construction  We used 2 AML1 mutants, D171N or S291fsX300, identified from case no. 5 or 27, respectively, among patients with MDS/AML.25,26 These mutants are hereafter referred to as AML1-D171N and AML1-S291fs. AML1 wild-type (WT; AML1b), AML1-D171N, or AML1-S291fs, which was fused with a FLAG epitope tag at the N-terminus, was inserted upstream of the IRES-EGFP cassette of pMYs-IG to generate pMYs-AML1 WT, D171N, or S291fs-IG, respectively. pMYs-mouse Evi1-IG were kindly provided by Dr T. Nakamura (The Cancer Institute, Tokyo, Japan).38  Transfection and retrovirus production  Plat-E39 packaging cells maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) were transfected with retroviral constructs by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations. The medium was changed 1 day after the transfection, and retroviruses were harvested 48 hours after the transfection as previously described.39,40 Titers of the retroviruses were assessed based on the number of neomycin-resistant colonies of the infected NIH3T3 cells (average: 107 infection U/mL) as described.39  Mouse BMT  Bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated from the femurs and tibias of C57BL/6 (Ly-5.1) donor mice (9-12 weeks of age) 4 days after intraperitoneal administration of 150 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cultured overnight in Î± minimal essential medium (Î±MEM) supplemented with 20% FCS and 50 ng/mL of mouse stem cell factor (SCF), mouse FLT3 ligand (FL), human IL-6, and human thrombopoietin (TPO; R&amp;amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The prestimulated cells were infected for 60 hours with the retroviruses harboring pMYs-AML1 WT, D171N, or S291fs-IG, or an empty vector as a control, using 6-well dishes coated with RetroNectin (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations. Then, 0.2 to 3.5 Ã— 106 of infected bone marrow cells (Ly-5.1) were injected through tail vein into C57BL/6 (Ly-5.2)â€“recipient mice (8-12 weeks of age) which had been administered a sublethal dose of 5.25 Gy or a lethal dose of 9.5 Gy total-body Î³-irradiation (135Cs). For the lethally irradiated mice, a radioprotective dose of 2 Ã— 105 of bone marrow cells (Ly-5.2) was simultaneously injected. Probabilities of overall survival of the mice that received transplants were estimated using the Kaplan-Meiermethod. All animal studies were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo.  Analysis of the mice that underwent transplantation  Engraftment of bone marrow cells infected with retroviruses was confirmed by measuring the percentage of GFP+ and Ly-5.1+ cells in peripheral blood obtained every 1 to 2 months after the transplantation.  After the morbid mice were killed, their tissue samples, including peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), spleen, liver, and kidney, were analyzed. Circulating blood cells were counted by an analyzer. Morphology of the peripheral blood was evaluated by staining of air-dried smears with Hemacolor (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E). Cytospin preparations of bone marrow and spleen cells were also stained with Hemacolor. Percentage of blasts, myelocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and erythroblasts was estimated by examination of at least 200 cells. To assess whether the leukemic cells were transplantable, 2 Ã— 105 to 106 total BM cells including blasts were injected into the tail veins of sublethally irradiated mice. A total of 2 or 3 recipient mice were used for each serial transplantation.  Flow cytometric analysis  Red blood cells were lysed by using Ammonium Chloride Lysing Reagent (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) in PB or single-cell suspensions of bone marrow and spleen. Washed cells were incubated for 15 minutes at 4Â°C with 2.4G2 antibody for blocking and then stained for 20 minutes at 4Â°C with the following monoclonal phycoerythrin (PE)â€“conjugated antibodies: Ly-5.1, Gr-1, CD11b, B220, CD3, CD41, c-Kit, Sca-1, CD34, and Ter119. Flow cytometric analysis of the stained cells was performed with FACSCalibur flow (BD Biosciences) equipped with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences) and Flowjo software (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA).  Diagnosis  Diagnosis was made according to the Bethesda proposals for classification of nonlymphoid hematopoietic neoplasms in mice.41  Real-time RT-PCR  Total RNA was extracted from BM cells using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA was prepared with the Superscript II RT kit (Invitrogen). Real-time reverse transcriptionâ€“polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using a LightCycler Workflow System (Roche Diagnostics). cDNA was amplified using a SYBR Premix EX Taq (TAKARA). Reaction was subject to one cycle of 95Â°C for 30 seconds, 45 cycles of PCR at 95Â°C for 5 seconds, 55Â°C for 10 seconds, and 72Â°C for 10 seconds. All samples were independently analyzed at least 3 times. The following primer pairs were used: 5â€²-CCAGATGTCACATGACAGTGGAAAGCACTA-3â€² (forward) and 5â€²-CCGGGTTGGCATGACTCATATTAACCATGG-3â€² (reverse) for Evi1; 5â€²-TACCTCAACCCCTGACAGCTATGG-3â€² (forward) and 5â€²-TCGGTTGGAGATATCAGAGTGCAG-3â€² (reverse) for MN1;42 and 5â€²-GTTATCCCATCTGCATCAGCATCTGG-3â€² (forward) and 5â€²-GGTCCTCTTCACTCTTCATGAACAGC-3â€² (reverse) for MDS1/Evi1.43 Relative gene expression levels were calculated using standard curves generated by serial dilutions of cDNA. Product quality was checked by melting curve analysis via LightCycler software (Roche Diagnostics). Expression levels were normalized by a control, the expression level of GAPDH mRNA.  Western blot analysis  To detect the expression of AML1 WT, mutants, or Evi1, equal numbers of spleen cells were lysed, and Western blotting was performed as described with minor modifications.13 Polyclonal rabbit anti-Evi1 antibody (a kind gift from Dr M. Kurokawa, Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan), or a monoclonal mouse anti-Flag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was used for Evi1 or AML1, respectively.  Southern blot analysis  Genomic DNA was extracted from BM or spleen cells. After enzymatic digestion of 10 Î¼g DNA with EcoRI followed by electrophoretic separation, proviruses were probed with a GFP probe.  Bubble PCR  A total of 10 Î¼g of genomic DNA extracted from BM or spleen cells was digested with EcoRI, and the fragments were ligated overnight at 16Â°C to a double-stranded bubble linker (5â€²-AATTGAAGGAGAGGACGCTGTCTG-TCGAAGGTAAGGAACGGACGAGAGAAGGGAGAG-3â€² and 5â€²-GACTC-TCCCTTCTCGAATCGTAACCGTTCGTACGAGAATCGCTGTCCTCTCC-TTC-3â€²).44 Next, PCR was performed on the ligation product using a linker-specific Vectorette primer (5â€²-CGAATCGTAACCGTTCGTACGAGAATCGCT-3â€²)44,45 and a long-terminal repeat (LTR)â€“specific primer (5â€²-CGAGCTCAATAAAAGAGCCCACAACCCC-3â€²) under the following conditions: one cycle of 95Â°C for 5 minutes, 10 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 seconds, and 67Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 3 minutes, 10 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 seconds, and 67Â°C (this annealing temperature was reduced by 1Â°C each cycle) for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 3 minutes, 15 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 seconds and 57Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 3 minutes, and one cycle of 72Â°C for 90 seconds. Next, nested PCR was performed on 2 Î¼L of PCR products using a linker-specific Vectorette primer and an LTR-specific primer (5â€²-ATAAAAGAGCCCACAACCCCTCACTCGG-3â€²) under the following conditions: 1 cycle of 95Â°C for 5 minutes, 35 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 seconds and 60Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 3 minutes, and 1 cycle of 72Â°C for 90 seconds. The PCR product was electrophoresed using 1.0% agarose gel. Individual bands were excised and purified using PCR clear (Promega, Madison, WI) and were sequenced to identify the integration site of retrovirus. We confirmed inverse repeat sequence â€œGGGGGTCTTTCAâ€� as a marker of junction between genomic DNA and retrovirus sequence.  Results  The ratio of AML1 mutant-transduced cells gradually increased over several months after transplantation  To examine the effect of AML1 mutants on the hematopoietic abnormality, we chose 2 distinct mutants, AML1-D171N and AML1-S291fsX300, which are found in patients with MDS/AML.25,26 The former has a point mutation in RHD, and the latter possesses a frameshift mutation in the C-terminal region, resulting in truncation of the authentic protein (Figure 1A). Ly-5.1 murine BM cells infected with retroviruses harboring AML1 WT, AML1-D171N, AML1-S291fsX300, or empty vector were transplanted into irradiated syngeneic Ly-5.2 mice. In most of mice that received transplants of AML1-D171Nâ€“ or S291fsX300-transduced cells (hereafter referred to as mice/D171N or mice/S291fs, respectively), the ratio of GFP+ and Ly-5.1+ cells gradually increased over several months after the transplantation (Figure 1B), but not in mice that received transplants of AML1 WT-transduced cells or control retrovirus-infected cells (hereafter referred to as mice/WT or mice/mock, respectively). Gradual increase of c-kit+ cells in the PB was also observed in the mice that received transplants of AML1 mutant-transduced cells during the observation period (Figure 1C). Cells positive for c-kit and GFPâ€”that is, c-kit+ cells transduced with AML1 mutantsâ€”were morphologically blasts with high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratios (data not shown). In fact, the percentage of blasts gradually increased in the PB of the mice that received transplants of AML1 mutant-transduced cells, especially the mice/D171N. Finally, most of mice/D171N or mice/S291fs became sick and died with latencies of 4 to 13 months after the transplantation, while mice/mock were healthy over the observation period (Figure 1D). Overall survival of mice/D171N was not significantly different from that of mice/S291fs (P = .218). Expression of the transduced AML1-D171N or AML1-S291fs in spleen cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Figure 2A). Two of the mice/WT died during the observation period. BM of the 2 mice was occupied with GFP/Ly5.1 double-negative cells. One of the mice/WT developed leukemia derived from recipient cells at 272 days after transplantation. The remaining one mouse/WT died of anemia with unknown reason at 355 days after transplantation.

(E) Evi1 synergized with AML1-D171N in inducing MDS/AML. D171N (n = 26; same as those in panel D), Evi1 (n = 8), D171N + Evi1 (n = 10), and mock (n = 16) transduced bone marrow cells were transplanted into mice. Figure 2 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 2 Expression of the transduced AML1-D171N, AML1-S291fs, and AML1 WT in spleen of the transplanted mice. (A) Lysates of spleen cells were immunoblotted with anti-Flag Ab. As a positive control, Plat-E packaging cells were transduced with mock (lane 1), AML1 WT (lane 2), AML1-D171N (lane 3), or AML1-S291fs (lane 4). Spleen cells were derived from mice/D171N (lanes 5-8), mice/S291fs (lanes 9-11), mice/WT (lane 12), mice/mock (lane 13), or control normal mouse (lane 14). White arrows indicate transduced AML1 WT, AML1-D171N, and AML1-S291fs. (B) AML1 WT-transduced cells were undetectable in PB at 1 month after the transplantation. Flow cytometric analysis of PB obtained from mice that received transplants of AML1-D171N, AML1-S291fs, AML1 WT, and mock at 1 month after transplantation. Interestingly, in the peripheral blood of mice/WT, GFP+ cell counts were extremely low 1 month after transplantation and thereafter became undetectable, despite the fact that 14% to 27% of the BM cells were positive for GFP before transplantation (Figures 1B,2B; Table S1, available on the Blood website; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article). Consistently, the expression of transduced AML1 WT was not detected in spleen cells of mice/WT (Figure 2A; mouse ID: 105). These data suggested that forced expression of AML1 WT in the stem cells had a negative effect on the survival and expansion of these cells in the BM. Recently, Tsuzuki et al reported that expression of the full-length isoform AML1b abrogated engraftment potential of murine long-term reconstituting stem cells in a mouse BMT model.46 Their result coincides with our result.  AML1-D171N and AML1-S291fs induced different diseases in mice that underwent transplantation  PB cell counts were different between mice/D171N and mice/S291fs; most mice/D171N (Figure 3A; lanes 1,2) showed leukocytosis, while mice/S291fs (Figure 3A; lane 3) showed leukocytopenia. This difference was significant (P = .007). Macroscopic observation of morbid mice revealed that severe hepatosplenomegaly was exclusively found in mice/D171N, but not in mice/S291fs (Figure 3E,F; Table S2).

(E,F) Weight of spleen and liver of morbid mice (mice/D171N or S291fs) or 1-year-old healthy mice (mice/WT or mock). Statistical differences were determined by 2-sample t test with Welch correction (*P &amp;lt; .05; **P &amp;lt; .01). Lane 1: mice/D171N without high expression of Evi1 in BM or not examined due to the lack of bone marrow samples (WBC, PLT, Hg, and MCV: n = 11; spleen: n = 5; and liver: n = 4). Lane 2: mice/D171N with high expression of Evi1 (n = 11). Lane 3: mice/S291fs (WBC, PLT, Hg, and MCV: n = 9; spleen and liver: n = 8). Lane 4: mice/WT (WBC, PLT, Hg, and MCV: n = 10; spleen and liver: n = 4). Lane 5: mice/mock (WBC, PLT, Hg, and MCV: n = 12; spleen: n = 6; and liver: n = 5). The smear specimens of peripheral blood were obtained every 1 to 2 months. The specimens showed that most of mice/D171N and mice/S291fs suffered from multilineage dysplasia characteristic of MDS. Erythroid dysplasia such as Howell-Jolly bodies, red cell polychromasia, and poikilocytosis (Figure 4A) were frequently detected in both mice. In BM specimens of morbid mice, orthochromatic giant erythroblasts and karyorrhexis were detected (Figure 4B). Erythroid dysplasia was more evident in mice/S291fs than in mice/D171N. As recently described in a mouse MDS model,15 increase of red blood cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was also observed in most mice/D171N and mice/S291fs (Figure 3D; Table S2). Myeloid dysplasia such as the pseudoâ€“Pelger-Huet anomaly (Figure 4C) was frequently detected in mice/D171N. Hypersegmented neutrophils (Figure 4D) and giant platelets (Figure 4F) were observed in 2 mice/D171N (mouse IDs 9 and 17). Collectively, AML1 mutants used in this study induced multilineage dysplasia, in particular in erythroid and myeloid lineages. Continuous pancytopenia was observed in 7 of 8 morbid mice/S291fs and 2 of 16 morbid mice/D171N, although BM of the morbid mice was not hypocellular but hypercellular or normocellular. Based on these findings, a final diagnosis was made by the ratio of blasts in the bone marrow according to the Bethesda proposals for classification of nonlymphoid hematopoietic neoplasms in mice.41 As a result, MDS/AML was recognized in 13 of 16 morbid mice/D171N and in 5 of 8 morbid mice/S291fs, while MDS-RAEB was recognized in 2 of 16 morbid mice/D171N and 2 of 8 morbid mice/S291fs (Table S2). One mouse/D171N was diagnosed with AML at 4 months after transplantation because we did not examine to see if the MDS phase had preceded AML (mouse ID 5). The leukemic cells derived from either mice/D171N or mice/S291fs were serially transplantable. We confirmed the serial transplantability in 11 mice/D171N (mouse IDs 4, 6, 9, 12-15, 17, 20, 22, and 26) and 6 mice/S291fs (mouse IDs 52, 54-56, 58, and 60). Penetrance of serial transplantation was 100%, except for mouse IDs 9 and 17; that is, 33% and 50%, respectively. Mice that underwent serial transplantation showed more aggressive status than primary mice and died with shorter latencies. Hematologic parameters of mice that underwent serial transplantation are shown in Table S3.

Images were obtained with a BH51 microscope and DP12 camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan); objective lens, UPlanFl (Olympus); magnification, Ã—1000. In summary, the pattern and degree of multilineage dysplasia differed among the mice that underwent transplantation. Although both mice/D171N and mice/S291fs died of MDS and MDS/AML within 4 to 13 months after transplantation, a marked difference existed in terms of clinical symptoms, including hematopoietic or macroscopic findings.  A distinct type of disease was identified in mice/D171N  Among the mice that underwent transplantation transduced with AML1-D171N, a distinct group was identified. GFP+ BM cells in 11 of 16 morbid mice/D171N (mouse IDs 4, 6, 7, 12-15, 19, 20, 22, and 26) displayed a similar phenotype, with high percentages of CD11b+ and B220+ cells (Figure 5; data not shown). All these mice/D171N showed dysplasia in myeloid and erythroid lineages for several months and died of MDS/AML with increased number of blasts, anemia, and, in some cases, thrombocytopenia (Table S2). These mice/D171N also showed severe hepatosplenomegaly (Figures 3E,F, 6A; Table S2), and histologic examination showed expansion of blasts and immature myeloid cells in the PB, BM, and spleen, and the invasion of these cells into hepatic portal areas in the liver and spaces among renal tubules in the kidney (Figure 6B,D,F). Giemsa staining of BM showed a high percentage of blasts (Figure 6H), in accordance with a high percentage of both GFP/c-kit double-positive cells by flow cytometolic analysis.

In contrast, the remaining 4 morbid mice/D171N diagnosed as MDS (mouse IDs 9 and 11) or MDS/AML (mouse IDs 10 and 17) showed heterologous phenotypes of GFP+ BM cells (data not shown). Although mouse IDs 9 and 17 displayed hepatosplenomegaly like other mice/D171N, they exhibited leukocytopenia with fewer blasts.  AML1-D171N collaborated with Evi1 in inducing MDS/AML  We then asked why even the same point mutant of AML1 caused different phenotypes of MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML. We assumed the possibility that the integration of retroviruses influenced the outcomes in the BMT model. To explore this, we first performed Southern blot analysis of BM of the morbid mice. A single or several proviral integrations were confirmed (Figure 7A). Next, we used the bubble PCR method to identify the integrated sites.7,44,45 A single or 2 integration sites were identified in each sample (Table 1). Interestingly, integrations near Evi1 site were found in 7 of 15 genomic DNA samples of BM cells derived from mice/D171N, but not from mice/S291fs. Moreover, retrospective examination revealed that these 7 mice presented nearly identical phenotypes, characterized by marked hepatosplenomegaly (Figure 6A), leukocytosis (Figure 3A), and biphenotypic surface markers (CD11b+ and B220+) of the leukemic cells (Figure 5), thus constituting a definite subgroup among mice/D171N. Southern blot analysis showed that all of the leukemic mice with high expression of Evi1 are monoclonal (except for mouse IDs 15 and 19), but the other leukemic mice without high expression of Evi1 are oligoclonal or have several integrations (Figure 7A). Noteworthy was the finding that the Evi1 site was not identified from the genomic DNA samples of mice/S291fs, even though the Evi1 site is a known common integration site of retroviruses.31â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“38 These led us to postulate that Evi1 collaborated with AML1-D171N in inducing the distinct type of MDS/AML. To test this, we examined whether the expression of Evi1 was enhanced in the BM cells in which the integration into an Evi1 site was identified. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of Evi1 were high in all the related samples (Figure 7C). Protein expression levels corresponded to mRNA expression levels of Evi1 (Figure 7D; data not shown). Interestingly, 4 samples derived from mice/D171N harboring no integration near Evi1 also displayed significantly high expression levels of Evi1 (mouse IDs 13, 19, 20, and 22), and the phenotypes of these mice were identical to those induced by AML1-D171Nâ€“transduced cells in which retroviruses were integrated into the Evi1 site. In these cases, the expression of Evi1 might have been enhanced secondarily by an unknown mechanism, or we simply failed to detect the integration site. The latter possibility was supported by the fact that multiple integrations were detected in these cases (Figure 7A; mouse IDs 13, 19, and 20). In any case, all the mice/D171N with enhanced expression of Evi1 in their BM cells displayed high percentages of blasts (Figure S1). We also examined whether the expression of MDS1/Evi1 was enhanced by the integration into an Evi1 site. The MDS1 gene is located approximately 240 kb upstream of Evi1, and MDS1/Evi1 is generated from the in-frame splicing of MDS1 to the second exon of Evi1.36,43 Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of MDS1/Evi1 were low and were not significantly increased when compared with controls (data not shown). The integration sites of Evi1 were focused on two regions (Table 1). One is 15 kb upstream of start site of Evi1 (mouse IDs 12, 14, 15), and another is 107 kb upstream of start site of Evi1 (mouse IDs 4, 6, 7, 26). Morishita et al reported that the retrovirus integrations had occurred near or in 5â€² noncoding exons of Evi1 gene.31 The integration site at 15 kb upstream of the start site of Evi1 that we found is near to the site they reported.  Figure 7 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 7 The mice/D171N with integration near Evi1 site were monoclonal. (A) Southern blot analysis of mice/D171N. DNA samples were digested with EcoRI, which cut the retrovirus only once within the multicloning site. Probes used were DNA fragments of the GFP coding sequence. Mouse IDs are shown at the top of the panel. (B) The mice/D171N + Evi1 were polyclonal. DNA samples were digested with EcoRI. Proviruses were probed with a GFP probe. (C) Real-time PCR for Evi1 in BM derived from morbid mice/D171N or mice/S291fs or mice/WT or mice/mock. In addition to 6 samples from mice/D171N harboring integration near Evi1 (mouse IDs 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, and 15), 4 samples derived from mice/D171N without integration near Evi1 display high expression levels of Evi1 (mouse IDs 13, 19, 20, and 22). RNA from normal BM cells served as a control (RNA level = 1). (D) Western blot of lysates from spleen cells of mice/D171N, mice/WT, and normal mice and PLAT-E as controls. Samples from mice/D171N confirmed high expression of Evi1 by RT-PCR showed expression of the protein (mouse IDs 6, 15, 20, and 22), but the other mice without high expression of Evi1 by RT-PCR did not express the protein (mouse IDs 11, 17, and 105). View inlineView popup Table 1 Analysis of integration site In vivo collaboration between Evi1 and AML1-D171N  Next, we tested to see if Evi1 expression collaborates with AML1-D171N in inducing leukemia in the BMT model. Cotransduction of AML1-D171N and Evi1 into BM cells resulted in rapid induction of the disease in the mice that underwent transplantation that was essentially identical with the disease that developed after a long latency in the mice/D171N (Figures 1E,5). In fact, all the mice displayed increased number of blasts in the PB within a month after the transplantation of BM cells transduced with Evi1/D171N. Southern blot analysis showed that these leukemic cells were polyclonal (Figure 7B). These results indicate that AML1-D171N and Evi1 collaborate to induce MDS/AML with a distinct phenotype. On the other hand, cotransduction of AML1-S291fs and Evi1 into BM cells did not induce MDS/AML in 5 months (data not shown). In the present work, mice that received transplants of BM cellâ€“transduced Evi1 alone did not present any abnormalities in 5 months (Figure 1E).  AML1-S291fs induced erythroid dysplasia with pancytopenia  In contrast to mice/D171N, most of mice/S291fs displayed remarkable erythroid dysplasia with continuous pancytopenia (Figures 3A-C,4A). A total of 2 of 8 mice/S291fs died of MDS-RAEB in which the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow was less than 20%, and 5 mice/S291fs developed MDS/AML. The mice displayed severe anemia but not leukocytosis in the PB, and the numbers of blasts were generally lower than those of MDS/AML mice transduced with AML1-D171N (Table S2). Surface markers of leukemic cells derived from mice/S291fs were different from those of mice/D171N (Figure S3).  We found integrations of the retrovirus in the intron of MN1 in 3 of 8 mice/S291fs (Table 1; mouse IDs 55, 56, and 58), and MN1 was overexpressed in the leukemic cells of these mice (Figure S2). The integration site was identical among these leukemic cells, indicating that leukemic cells of the 3 mice were derived from a single hematopoietic progenitor and that overexpression of MN1 induced expansion of the transduced stem cells during the 3-day culture period before the transplantation. Indeed, the mice with the integration at that MN1 site developed MDS/AML with shorter latencies (Table S2).  Discussion  We have established a mouse BMT model for MDS and MDS/AML using AML1 mutants derived from patients with MDS, although previous studies either using similar BMT models or knock-in mice of AML1 mutants failed to do so. There are several potential explanations for this discrepancy. First, because most AML1 mutants work as dominant-negative forms, high expression levels of the mutants would be critical to effectively inhibit WT AML1. In this aspect, our BMT model has an advantage, using the efficient retrovirus vector pMYs40 designed to achieve high expression in hematopoietic progenitor cells and, unlike most other retrovirus vectors, harbors splice donor and acceptor sites derived from the MFG vector to increase expression levels.40,47 Second, using the efficient packaging cell line Plat-E,39 we achieved high titers of retroviruses (average: 107 infection U/mL), which could result in the higher numbers of retrovirus integrations. This also increases the probabilities of up-regulating or disrupting important genes that collaborate with AML1 mutants in inducing MDS and/or MDS/AML. Alternatively, it is also possible that the positions of AML1 mutations are critical for the biological effect. We believe that the combination of these factors has put our system into practice.  In the present MDS model, we used 2 AML1 mutants, D171N and S291fsX300. The latter, a C-terminalâ€“truncated form, is more potent as a dominant-negative form than the former, which harbors a point mutation in the RHD.25,26 In this context, it is reasonable that the S291fs mutant induced the disease in the mice that underwent transplantation with a higher penetrance (Figure 1D). More important, expression of these mutants induced MDS/AML of distinct phenotypes in the mice that underwent transplantation: AML1-S291fs induced pancytopenia associated with dysplasia in the erythroid lineage, while AML1-D171N frequently induced hepatoslenomegaly and leukocytosis associated with marked myeloid dysplasia. This suggests that even different mutations of the same gene could induce heterogeneous diseases. As previously described,25,26 AML1-D171N lost DNA-binding ability and hence transactivation potential because it possessed a point mutation in RHD essential for DNA-binding, while AML1-S291fs had increased DNA-binding ability but lost transactivation potential because it had an intact RHD but lacked a C-terminal transactivation domain. Thus, the different biological outcomes induced by AML1 mutants could be explained in part by structural and functional differences between the mutants. In addition to the dominant-negative functions, these mutants may also have gain of function; the fact that AML1-KO mice did not develop leukemia18 indicates that deletion of AML1 alone is not sufficient to induce leukemia, suggesting the possibility that the AML1 mutants have gain of function as well. Because AML1 associates and forms a ternary complex with other transcriptional factors and cofactors via its specific domains, it is possible that these mutants exert different effects on the proliferation and differentiation of BM cells in the various contexts.  In BMT models using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, the genes near the retrovirus integration sites are thought to affect the outcomes.30â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“38 This sometimes obscures the significance of the transduced gene, but simultaneously will give us clues to understanding the collaboration of multiple genes in the development of leukemias. One of the intriguing findings of the present work is that high expression of Evi1, either caused by virus integration or by unknown mechanisms, was able to collaborate with AML1-D171N in inducing the homogeneous disease characterized by leukocytosis, severe myelodysplasia, and marked hepatosplenomegaly that always developed to overt leukemia with high percentages of B220+ and CD11b+ blasts. Together with the recent findings that Evi1 expression was observed in patients with MDS and AML,36,48 and that Evi1 alone did not induce AML in mouse models,14,34,49,50 our result strongly suggested that AML1-D171N collaborated with Evi1 in inducing MDS/AML. It is interesting to note that AML1-S291fs never collaborated with Evi1 during our examination (Table 1), again suggesting that these 2 AML1 mutations transform hematopoietic cells through distinct mechanisms. Importantly, we confirmed the collaboration between AML1-D171N and Evi1 in an in vivo experiment. Cotransduction of AML1-D171N and Evi1 into BM cells resulted in rapid induction of MDS/AML in the mice that received transplants. In addition, the leukemic cells in most of these mice included more clones than those in mice/D171N (Figure 7B), indicating cooperation of Evi1 and AML1-D171N. However, leukemic cells from one mouse (ID 305) seemed to be monoclonal and to contribute to oligoclonal leukemia of mouse 304. In addition, it took 2 to 3 months for leukemias induced by the combination of AML1-D171N and Evi1 to kill the mice that received transplants. Together, these result suggested that while AML1-D171N and Evi1 overexpression collaborated in inducing leukemia, additional steps were required for efficient transformation of hematopoietic progenitors. In the absence of Evi1 high expression, AML1-D171N caused MDS or MDS/AML with low percentages of blasts in BM but still with hepatosplenomegaly. This indicates that hepatosplenomegaly had something to do with AML1-D171N.  In contrast to mice/D171N, most mice/S291fs succumbed to either MDS-RAEB with fatal severe anemia following continuous pancytopenia or MDS/AML without leukocytosis. The integration site in the intron 1 of the MN1 gene found in leukemic cells of 3 mice was derived from the same cell. We also found that MN1 was overexpressed in the leukemic cells of these mice, suggesting that overexpression of MN1 induced effective expansion of leukemic stem cells. Recently, Heuser et al reported that high expression of MN1 correlated with poor outcome in AML with normal cytogenetics.51 Moreover, Slape et al identified MN1 as potential collaborators of NUP98/HOXD13 to induce leukemia.42 Further work will be required to investigate the role of MN1 in MDS/AML.  One fundamental question of this study was whether AML1 mutants alone induce MDS and MDS/AML. In our experiments, 5 of the 6 surviving mice/D171N showed a disappearance of GFP+ cells in time, suggesting that AML1-D171N alone was not able to induce MDS/AML. Previous studies using gene-engineered mice and a BMT model demonstrated that AML1 fusions caused by chromosomal translocations alone were insufficient to induce AML,7â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“12 except for AML1-MDS1-Evi1, which by itself induced AML with a long latency.52 In addition, several lines of evidence30â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“38 that implicated the integration site of retroviruses for different biological outcomes led us to consider the same possibility in this BMT model. Indeed, we identified frequent retrovirus integrations near the Evi1 gene in the BM cells derived from mice/D171N whose leukemic cells displayed nearly identical phenotypes and concomitant elevated expression of Evi1. Importantly, coexpression of AML1-D171N and Evi1 induced the same leukemia with shorther latencies, demonstrating the collaboration between AML1-D171N and Evi1 in vivo. These results showed the power of in vivo insertional mutagenesis of retroviruses in a search for genes involved in the pathogenesis of MDS and MDS/AML.  Finally, it is important to relate these in vivo results to clinical data of the human disease. The recent finding25â‡“â€“27 that AML1 point mutations in the C-terminal regions were almost exclusively found in MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML, but not in de novo AML, coincided with our data that AML1-S291fs tended to induce MDS-RAEBâ€“like symptoms in this BMT model. Clinical findings25â‡“â€“27 that the RHD point mutation was often found in de novo AML, mainly AML M0, in addition to MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML, was also in accordance with our data that AML1-D171N induced more progressive MDS/AML with higher percentages of blasts when compared with AML1-S291fs. Classification of MDS and MDS/AML is always controversial because of the heterogeneity of the disease.1,2,27 In the future, this disease will be reclassified based on genetic alterations and their combinations.  In summary, we have generated a mouse BMT model of MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML. The current BMT model, mimicking AML1-related MDS, will be useful for understanding molecular pathogenesis and establishing new therapeutic strategy for MDS and MDS/AML. Somatically acquired point mutations of AML1/RUNX1 gene have been recently identified in rare cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Moreover, germ line mutations of AML1 were found in an autosomal dominant disease, familial platelet disorder with predisposition to AML (FPD/AML), suggesting that AML1 mutants, as well as AML1 chimeras, contribute to the transformation of hematopoietic progenitors. In this report, we showed that AML1 point mutations were found in 6 (46%) of 13 MDS patients among atomic bomb (A-bomb) survivors in Hiroshima. Unlike acute or chronic leukemia patients among A-bomb survivors, MDS patients exposed relatively low-dose radiation and developed the disease after a long latency period. AML1 mutations also were found in 5 (38%) of 13 therapy-related AML/MDS patients who were treated with alkylating agents with or without local radiation therapy. In contrast, frequency of AML1 mutation in sporadic MDS patients was 2.7% (2 of 74). Among AML1 mutations identified in this study, truncated-type mutants lost DNA binding potential and trans-activation activity. All missense mutations with one exception (Gly42Arg) lacked DNA binding ability and down-regulated the trans-activation potential of wild-type AML1 in a dominant-negative fashion. The Gly42Arg mutation that was shared by 2 patients bound DNA even more avidly than wild-type AML1 and enhanced thetrans-activation potential of normal AML1. These results suggest that AML1 point mutations are related to low-dose radiation or alkylating agents and play a role distinct from that of leukemogenic chimeras as a result of chromosomal translocations caused by sublethal radiation or topoisomerase II inhibitors.  Introduction  Genes encoding transcription factors that play critical roles in hematopoiesis are frequently involved in the genetic alterations in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A good example is AML1/RUNX1/CBFA2, which encodes a component of the AML1â€“core binding factor Î² (CBFÎ²) transcriptional factor complex. Analysis of AML1- and CBFÎ²-deficient mice revealed that both factors are indispensable for the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis.1-5 AML1 is also well known as one of the genes most frequently involved in the chromosomal translocations of human leukemia.6 It is generally accepted that the AML1-ETO fusion transcription factor that is created by the 8;21 translocations contributes to leukemogenesis through suppression of the trans-activation potential of the AML1-CBFÎ² complex in a dominant-negative fashion.7  In addition to chromosomal translocations, recent studies have identified several somatically acquired point mutations of theAML1 gene that occurred exclusively within the DNA bindingrunt homology domain (RHD) in sporadic AML/MDS patients.8 9 Because of the low frequencies of point mutations (0%-7.1%) and the divergent effects of these mutants on thetrans-activation activity of the AML1-CBFÎ² complex,8 the biologic significance of these mutations in the malignant transformation of hematopoietic progenitors was initially controversial. Recent findings, however, support the hypothesis that AML1 point mutations contribute to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). First, it has been demonstrated that AML1 mutations occurred at a substantially higher frequency in specific subtypes of AML, such as poorly differentiated AML M0 (22%) and myeloid malignancies associated with acquired trisomy 21 (38%).10 Second, germ line mutations of AML1 have been shown to occur in a rare autosomal dominant disorder, familial platelet disorder with predisposition to AML (FPD/AML).11 12 Third, many of the point mutations identified in the diseases mentioned above have been found to overlap. Finally, the crystal structure of the RHD-CBFÎ²-DNA ternary complex has been determined,13-16 and it has been revealed that most of the amino acid residues replaced by the missense mutations were those that directly contact DNA.  The AML1 gene also was reported as a target of gene alteration by ionizing radiation (IR) and anticancer drugs in experimental systems.17 18 Moreover, human leukemias associated with AML1 gene translocations after anticancer therapy or low-dose radiation have been reported,19 20although the role of radiation in these patients is controversial.21 In this report, we tested the frequency of point mutations in the AML1 gene in MDS patients among atomic bomb (A-bomb) survivors in Hiroshima, as well as in therapy-related MDS/AML. We found unexpectedly high frequencies ofAML1 mutations in these patients, suggesting that radiation and anticancer drugs contribute to the development of MDS/AML through mutations of the AML1 gene.  Patients and methods  Patients&#x27; materials  We examined 74 cases of sporadic MDS and 13 cases of MDS among A-bomb survivors, who were diagnosed at Hiroshima University Hospital between 1995 and 2001. According to the Dosimetry System 1986 (DS86), free-in-air kerma at a distance of 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 km from the hypocenter of Hiroshima is approximately 4, 0.5, 0.07, and 0.01 Gy, respectively.22 23 Taking account of exposure from residual radiation, we defined those who exposed A-bomb within 3 km of the hypocenter as A-bomb survivors. We also examined 6 cases of therapy-related MDS/AML, 67 cases of myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) in the chronic phase (13 myelofibrosis [MF], 21 essential thrombocythemia [ET], 12 polycythemia vera [PV], 1 atypical MPD, and 20 chronic myeloid leukemia [CML]), 2 cases of paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria (PNH), 2 cases of CML in blast crisis, 7 cases of secondary leukemia (1 MF, 2 ET, 3 PV, and 1 PNH), and 30 cases of healthy volunteers. Diagnosis was based on morphologic and immunophenotypic studies according to French-American-British (FAB) classification.24 Cytogenetic analyses with standard procedures were performed according to the International System of Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (1995). Patient samples were taken after obtaining informed consent and approval from the institutional review board at Hiroshima University. Mononuclear cells were isolated from bone marrow or peripheral blood samples by Ficoll-Conray density gradient centrifugation. Genomic DNA was extracted with a Puregene Kit (Gentra, Minneapolis, MN), and total RNA was extracted using a TRIzol Kit (Gibco Life Technologies, Rockville, MD), according to the manufacturers&#x27; instructions.  Polymerase chain reactionâ€“single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP)  100 ng genomic DNA was amplified by PCR in a total volume of 20 Î¼L containing 1â€‰Ã— PCR buffer (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA), 0.2 mM dNTP (deoxynucleoside triphosphate; Perkin-Elmer), 0.2 Î¼M of each primer, and 0.5 unit of AmpliTaq (Perkin-Elmer). PCR of exons 3 through 5 of the AML1 gene performed using the following flanking intronic, forward/reverse primers; 5â€²-AGCTGTTTGCAGGGTCCTAA-3â€²/5â€²-GTCCTCCCACCACCCTCT-3â€² for exon 3, 5â€²-CATTGCTATTCCTCTGCAACC-3â€²/5-CCATGAAACGTGTTTCAAGC-3â€² for exon 4, and 5â€²-CCACCAACCTCATTCTGTTT-3â€²/5â€²-AGACATGGTCCCTGAGTATA-3â€² for exon 5. To identify AML1 mutations, SSCP analysis was performed on a GenePhor system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, England) using 12.5% GeneGel Excel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After electrophoresis, gels were silver-stained to visualize the bands. All PCR products with abnormal SSCP bands were confirmed by an independent amplification and SSCP analysis.  Identification of AML1 mutations  PCR products that showed abnormal bands were subcloned into a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and 8 independent clones were sequenced in both directions using BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer) and analyzed on ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Perkin-Elmer). To confirm mutations, PCR products from cDNA were also sequenced. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using total RNA and random hexamers with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Gibco). The cDNA products were amplified with the following primers: 5â€²-GCAGGGTCCTAACTCAATCG-3â€²/5â€²-GCTCGGAAAAGGACAAGCTC-3â€², and subcloned PCR products were sequenced as described above.  Cell culture and transfection  The cell lines Cos-7 and HeLa were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (Gibco), and U937 in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cos-7 cells were transfected using SuperFect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions. For reporter assay, HeLa cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method25 and U937 cells by Effectene (Qiagen).  Plasmid constructions  The entire coding regions of wild-type AML1 or CBFÎ² generated by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). PCR-generated fragments encoding AML1 or AML1 mutants with an N-terminus FLAG (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) epitope were also subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector. The integrity of the amplified sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A reporter plasmid containing a macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR) promoter (pM-CSF-R-luc)26 was kindly provided by Dr D. Zhang (Beth Israel Hospital and Harvard Medical School).  Immunoprecipitations and Western blot analysis  Cos-7 cells were transfected using Superfect (Qiagen) with 5 Î¼g of pcDNA3.1-CBFÎ² and 5 Î¼g FLAG-tagged AML1 or AML1 mutants expression plasmid. After 24 hours, the cells were lysed in the lysis buffer (20 mM Tris[tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane]-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 1% Nonidet P40; 1 mM phenylmethlsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF); 1 Î¼g/mL leupeptin). The lysates were sonicated and then incubated with protein G (Pharmacia Biotech) to block nonspecific binding proteins. A portion of each lysate was removed for immunoblot analysis. A 20-Î¼L volume of a 50% slurry of antiâ€“FLAG M2 beads (Sigma, St Louis, MO) was added to the lysates, incubated for 4 hours at 4Â°C, and washed 3 times with lysis buffer. FLAG beads were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin prior to addition to the lysates. For Western blot, the lysates or the supernatants from immune complex beads after boiling in Laemmli buffer were separated by 15% sodium dodecyl sulfateâ€“polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and transferred to Hybond ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBS-T (0.1% Tween-20) and hybridized sequentially with primary antibodies and a horseradish peroxidaseâ€“conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The primary antibodies used in this study were anti-M2 antibody (Sigma), anti-AML1 polyclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products, Boston MA), and anti-CBFÎ² polyclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products). Bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using a Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  Electrophoretic mobility shift assay  Nuclear extracts from Cos-7 cells, which were transiently transfected with the corresponding expression plasmid, were prepared as described previously.27 Protein concentrations were determined with Bradford reagents (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed as previously described.28 DNA binding reactions were prepared in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-Nâ€²-2-ethanesulfonic acid), 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ethylene glycol-bis (Î²-aminoethylether)-N, N, Nâ€², Nâ€²-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 0.4 mM dithiothreitol, 40 mM KCl, and 60 Î¼g of salmon sperm DNA per milliliter. Annealed oligomers containing the AML1 binding site were labeled with Î±-[32P]dATP (deoxyadenosine triphosphate; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a standard Klenow reaction mixture. For competition studies, 100 ng unlabeled, annealed oligomers containing the wild-type (TGTGGT) or mutated (TGTTAG) AML binding site was added into the DNA binding reaction mixtures. For supershift analyses, 1 Î¼g of AML1 antibody was used.  Transcriptional assay  HeLa cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate precipitates containing the luciferase reporter plasmid pM-CSF-R-luc, pcDNA3.1-CBFÎ², and pcDNA3.1-FLAG-tagged AML1 or AML1 mutants expression plasmid. The total amount of plasmid for each transfection was adjusted to 9.25 Î¼g by adding empty expression plasmid. Cells were harvested and lysed 48 hours after transfection, and luciferase assays using a luminometer Fluroskan Ascent (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) were performed by Dual luciferase assay systems (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions. Results of the reporter assays represented the average values for relative luciferase activity generated from 3 independent experiments that were normalized using the activity of pRL-tk (Promega) as an internal control. To analyze functional competitions between wild-type AML1 and mutants, U937 cells were transfected with pM-CSF-R-luc, wild-type AML1, and AML1 mutants expression plasmid using Effectene (Qiagen). Empty plasmid was added to bring the total amount of DNA per transfection to 2.8 Î¼g. Luciferase assays were performed as described above.  Results  High frequency of AML1 mutations in radiation-associated and therapy-related MDS/AML  To investigate the AML1 mutations in radiation-associated and therapy-related MDS/AML, we analyzed exons 3 through 5 (corresponding to amino acid 1 to 177) of the AML1gene by PCR-SSCP assay using genomic DNA extracted from mononuclear cells in the bone marrow of patients. Mutations were further confirmed by sequence analysis of RT-PCR products. AML1 mutations were found in only 2 (2.7%) of 74 sporadic MDS patients, in accordance with previous studies8-11 (Table1). In contrast, AML1mutations were identified in 6 (46%) of 13 MDS cases, who had been within 3 km of the hypocenter of the atomic bomb explosion in Hiroshima (see â€œPatients and methodsâ€�). The frequency of AML1mutations in MDS patients among A-bomb survivors was significantly higher than that in sporadic MDS cases (Pâ€‰&amp;lt;â€‰.0001). The clinical findings of these patients are summarized in Table2. Unlike acute and chronic leukemia patients among A-bomb survivors, only 3 (22%) of 14 MDS patients had been within 1 km of the hypocenter. Two cases had silent mutations (Pro157syn and Thr101syn), 3 cases had missense mutations (Gly42Arg, Asp171Asn, and Gly42Arg), and one case had a frame shift/nonsense mutation (Ser70fsTer93). Of sporadic MDS patients with AML1mutations, one patient (case 7) had a past history of manufacturing a poison gas (mustard gas) during World War II.  View inlineView popup Table 1. The frequency of AML1 mutations in the specific subtype of MDS View inlineView popup Table 2. Clinical and cytogenetical features of the MDS patients Next, we analyzed the mutations of therapy-related MDS/AML cases. Missense mutations were found in 2 (33%) of 6 cases (Table3). A refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEBt) patient (case 9) after chemotherapy with mainly alkylating agents and a long period of high-dose radiation therapy for astrocytoma had a missense mutation (Arg177Gln), and the other patient (case 10, Gly138_Arg139insGlyGly), who had been exposed to the A-bomb at a point 4.0 kilometers from the hypocenter, developed AML M0 after intensive multidrug chemotherapy and radiation therapy for B-cell lymphoma.  View inlineView popup Table 3. Clinical features and mutation characteristics of the patients with therapy-related leukemia Finally, of the 7 patients who developed AML after myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) or other hematologic diseases, 3 patients (43%) had missense or nonsense mutations (Table 4). These 3 patients were treated with busulfan, while none of the other 4 patients received this alkylating agent. Case 11, who developed AML after myelofibrosis, had been treated with radiation therapy for splenomegaly. Cases 11 and 12 had had no mutations and chromosomal abnormalities in the chronic phase of MPD. No AML1 mutations were found in 47 MPD and 20 CML patients in the chronic phase.  View inlineView popup Table 4. Clinical features and mutation characteristics of the patients with leukemia secondary to MPD The AML1 mutations identified in our study are summarized in Figure 1. We observed virtually equal intensities of normal and shifted bands in the PCR-SSCP analysis of all the samples with AML1 mutations and obtained comparable frequencies of normal and mutated results in the sequence analysis. In addition, germ line genomic DNA sequences were examined in specimens from nonleukemic organs from 6 cases (cases 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 12) and found to be normal (data not shown), suggesting that mutations of theAML1 gene were monoallelic at the somatic level. Mutations of the CEBPA gene, which encodes the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein Î± (C/EBPÎ±) were not detected in this study.  Fig. 1.

Abilities of AML1 mutants to bind DNA and to heterodimerize with CBFÎ²  RHD mediates both DNA binding and heterodimerization with CBFÎ². To analyze the DNA binding ability of AML1 mutants, a radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe containing the consensus binding sequence for AML1 and nuclear extracts from Cos-7 cells transfected with AML1 mutants were used in electromobility shift analysis (EMSA). A DNA/protein complex was detected when using nuclear extract from a transfectant expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type AML1 (Figure 2A, lane 2) that was not observed when using an extract from the mock transfectant (lane 1). This complex was supershifted with a specific serum against AML1 (lane 3) and was competed for by the nonradiolabeled oligonucleotide containing AML1 binding site (lane 4), but was not competed for by those containing a mutated AML1 binding site (lane 5), indicating that the complex contains AML1. The complex was not detected using extracts from the transfectants of AML1 mutants that occurred in RHD (lanes 6-8 and 10-13), while the intensity of complex was enhanced using an extract from the transfectant expressing the Gly42Arg mutant (lane 9), indicating that all the AML1 mutants except Gly42Arg lack DNA-binding potential.

Abilities of AML1 mutants to bind DNA and to heterodimerize with CBFÎ².(A) DNA binding potential of AML1 mutants analyzed by EMSA using nuclear extract from Cos-7 cells transfected with wild-type AML1 or mutated AML1 expression plasmid vectors. The oligonucleotides used as competitors were as follows: â€œWâ€� containing one wild-type AML1 binding site (CGAGTATTGTGGTTAATACG); â€œMâ€� containing one mutated AML1 binding site (CGAGTATTGTTAGTAATACG). (B) Heterodimerization ability of AML1 mutants with CBFÎ². Cos-7 cells were cotransfected with an expression vector containing CBFÎ² cDNA and those containing either wild-type AML1 or mutated AML1 cDNA. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with antiâ€“FLAG M2 antibody, and then proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis (WB) using anti-CBFÎ² antibody (top). The expression levels of CBFÎ² and AML1 in total cell lysates were detected by immunoblot analysis with anti-CBFÎ² antibody (upper middle) and antiâ€“FLAG M2 antibody (lower middle), respectively. The AML1 expression levels also were analyzed by anti-AML1 antibody (bottom). The numbers of AML1 mutants (1-10) are shown in Figure 1. To test whether AML1 mutants are able to interact with CBFÎ², we performed immunoblot analysis after immunoprecipitation. Cos-7 cells were cotransfected the FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutated AML1 (Figure2B, lower 2 panels), together with CBFÎ² (second panel). CBFÎ² was coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged wild-type AML1 by beads coated with anti-FLAG antibody (top panel, lane 3). CBFÎ² also was coimmunoprecipitated with missense AML1 mutants (lanes 7-11), but not with truncated type mutants (lanes 4-6). These results suggested that the loss of the heterodimerization with CBFÎ² depends on a deletion within RHD.  Transcriptional potential of AML1 mutants  To investigate the transcriptional activities of the AML1 mutants, reporter experiments were performed using the promoter of M-CSFR, which is known to be transcriptionally regulated by AML1.26 When wild-type AML1 and CBFÎ² were cotransfected in HeLa cells, the promoter activity was induced 8-fold compared to transfection with CBFÎ² alone (Figure 3A, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, none of the nonsilent mutants except Gly42Arg induced significant trans-activation (lanes 3-10), in accordance with their DNA binding abilities (Figure2A). To examine whether AML1 mutants act as dominant negative inhibitors of wild-type AML1, we performed the same reporter assay using U937 monocytic cells, in which the activity of the M-CSFR promoter was trans-activated by transfecting AML1 alone in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3B). When the truncated type AML1 mutants (mutants 1 to 3) were cotransfected with wild-type AML1, the promoter activities were not affected. In contrast, 4 missense type AML1 mutants (mutants 6, 8, 9, and 10), which lack the DNA-binding ability but retain the potential to bind CBFÎ² (Figure 2A-B), suppressed thetrans-activation activity of wild-type AML1 in a dose-dependent fashion. As expected, the Gly42Arg mutant induced the promoter activity more efficiently than wild-type AML1. Thus, AML1 mutants identified in MDS/AML patients had significantly different effects on the same M-CSFR promoter.  Fig. 3. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Fig. 3. Transcriptional potential of AML1 mutants.(A) Transcriptional activities of the AML1 mutants in HeLa cells. Cells were transfected with 5 Î¼g of pM-CSF-R-luc, 3 Î¼g of FLAG-tagged AML1 or AML1 mutant expression vector, 1 Î¼g of the CBFÎ² expression vector, and 0.25 Î¼g of pRL-tk as an internal control to normalize luciferase activities for transfection efficiency. The levels of expression of CBFÎ² and AML1 were detected by Western blot analysis with anti-CBFÎ² antibody (middle) and antiâ€“FLAG M2 antibody (bottom), respectively. (B) Transcriptional activities of the AML1 mutants in U937 cells. Cells were transfected with 2 Î¼g of pM-CSF-R-luc reporter plasmid, an indicated amount of AML1 expression constructs, and 0.2 Î¼g of pRL-tk as an internal control that normalizes luciferase activities for transfection efficiency. The expression vector containing wild-type AML1 (0.2 Î¼g) was cotransfected with increasing doses (0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 Î¼g) of expression vectors containing various AML1 mutants. Each value represents the mean of 3 independent experiments. The error bars indicate the mean Â± SD. The numbers of AML1 mutants (1-10) are shown in Figure 1. Discussion  In this paper, we report that AML1 point mutations were detected in virtually half of late-onset MDS patients among the A-bomb survivors of Hiroshima. AML1 was also frequently mutated in MDS/AML patients after treatments that contain alkylating agents and/or local radiation for nonhematopoietic malignancies or MPD. Although we performed PCR-SSCP analysis under optimized conditions, we can&#x27;t exclude the possibility that some mutants were not detectable by our method. Therefore, the actual mutation frequency could be higher.  The incidence of acute and chronic leukemia among A-bomb survivors was sharply dose-dependent, and the leukemia developed after a short latency period. Leukemias appeared after a minimum latency period of 2-3 years, reached a maximum after 6-7 years, and then decreased slowly with time (Figure 4).29 In contrast, the dose-dependency of the risk of other tumors was less prominent, and the incidence of these diseases increased after long minimum latency periods of 10 or more years and continued to increase with time.29 Most of the MDS patients in our study received a low radiation dose judging by their proximity to the hypocenter, as shown in Table 2. Indeed, with the exception of 3 cases, the estimated radiation dose of these patients was below 50 cGy, according to the DS86.22 23 This apparent difference in the distribution of radiation dose between leukemia and late-onset MDS among A-bomb survivors may be interpreted, at least in part, by molecular mechanisms that contribute to the transformation of hematopoietic progenitors. Leukemogenic fusion genes as a result of nonrandom chromosomal translocations are detected in approximately half of acute leukemia patients30 but are relatively rare in MDS cases,31 many of which are generally considered to develop as a result of the accumulation of gene deletions and point mutations.32 Thus, chromosomal translocations caused by double-strand DNA breaks resulting from high dose radiation are likely to contribute to the development of acute and chronic leukemia after a short latency time, whereas point mutations of genes induced by low-dose radiation may contribute to the development of MDS among A-bomb survivors decades later.

Langlois et al33 reported the increased frequency of somatic cell mutations at the glycophorin A (GPA) locus in red blood cells (RBCs) among A-bomb survivors. Although the variant frequencies (VFs) at the GPA locus increased in a dose-dependent fashion among survivors exposed to low-dose exposure (&amp;lt; 1.7 Gy), large fluctuations in VFs were seen for moderate-dose survivors (1.7 to 5 Gy), and VFs were uniformly low for high-dose survivors (&amp;gt; 5 Gy). They interpreted these apparently paradoxical results in terms of the numbers of surviving hematopoietic stem cells, which decrease exponentially with the radiation dose. Because a low-dose exposure of 50 cGy would produce minimal cell kill and induce a VF of around 10â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’6, the number of stem-cell mutations per A-bomb survivor would be 10 to 100, while an exposure of 8 Gy would reduce the stem-cell pool to about 102-103 cells, so that even with an expected VF of 200â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’6 no mutation would be recorded in most individuals. Importantly, the ratio of RBCs harboring the GPA mutations in each individual did not increase with time.34 In contrast, almost all of the bone marrow cells in MDS patients in our study harbored AML1 mutations, judging by the intensity of normal and shifted bands in SSCP analysis, suggesting that the cells expressing mutated AML1 obtained a growth advantage and ultimately occupied the space for hematopoiesis.  A question may be raised that if the MDS patients among A-bomb survivors in this study acquired their AML1 mutations at the time of exposure, then 50 years is too long to develop MDS. The pedigrees of FPD/AML may provide the answer.11 12 AML is mainly an adult-onset disease in FPD/AML patients, suggesting that the accumulation of additional gene alterations required to transform hematopoietic progenitors takes decades, even though all stem cells of FPD/AML patients harbor AML1 gene mutation. Thus, it is not surprising that one stem cell that acquired AML1 mutation took a half century to develop MDS.  Alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors are 2 major drugs that would induce distinctive therapy-related MDS/AML (t-MDS/AML). Patients who develop AML after exposure to alkylating agents mostly have long latency periods, and AML is often preceded by a myelodysplastic phase. Deletion or loss of chromosome 5 or 7,35 as well as mutations of genes such as p53, are frequently observed.36 In contrast, AML cases after exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors typically have a short latency time without prior MDS and harbor balanced translocations involving chromosome bands 3q26, 11q23, and 21q22.35 All t-MDS/AML patients in our study who had an AML1 mutation were treated with alkylating agents, with or without local radiation, and had relatively long latency periods (range, 60-182 months; median, 123 months) without chromosomal translocations, suggesting that there is a close relation between AML1 mutation and t-MDS/AML associated with alkylating agents, although further large studies are necessary to confirm this. Also, it remains to be established whether AML1 mutations in t-AML secondary to MPD were induced in normal hematopoietic progenitors by alkylating agents or were acquired in abnormal progenitors as a second hit during the progression from preleukemic phase to overt leukemia.  The crystal structure of the runt domain-CBFÎ²-DNA ternary complex has been determined recently and provides a structural basis for the effects of human disease-associated mutations on the biologic function of the AML1 protein.13-16 DNA binding is mediated by 3 loops called loop(Î²A&#x27;-B), loop(Î²E&#x27;-F), and C-terminal tail in the runt domain, and the amino acid residues (Arg80, Lys83, Thr84, Arg135, Arg139, Gly141, Arg142, Gly143, Ile168, Thr169, Val170, Asp171, Arg174, and Arg177) that directly contact the DNA were determined. Half of these residues (Arg80, Lys83, Arg135, Arg139, Asp171, Arg174, and Arg177) were found to be the targets of amino acid replacement by missense mutations in de novo MDS/AML and/or FPD/AML pedigrees in previous reports. Conversely, all missense mutations, with one exception (His58Asn, discussed below), that were identified in previous papers were mapped to these 3 loops, and biochemical data for these mutants, as well as for truncated type mutations as a result of frame shift, demonstrated the lack of DNA binding potential.8 9 11 13 14 In contrast, amino acid residues in domains responsible for binding CBFÎ², which are distinct from those involved in DNA binding, were never reported to be mutated in MDS/AML. In our study, all missense mutations but one (Gly42Arg) also occurred in the 3 loops responsible for DNA binding and were associated with a loss of DNA binding ability (Table 5 and Figure 2A), indicating that AML1 mutations associated with low-dose radiation and alkylating agents, as well as in de novo MDS/AML and FPD/AML, contribute to the transformation of hematopoietic progenitors by altering the DNA binding potential of this critical transcription factor in hematopoiesis.  View inlineView popup Table 5. Summary of mutations found in this study Although almost all the missense and truncated-type mutants of AML1 in the previous reports and in this paper lose DNA binding potential, and thus lack the trans-activation activity when tested by reporter assay using the M-CSFR promoter (Figure 3A), the missense mutations down-regulated the trans-activation potential of wild-type AML1 in a dominant-negative fashion, while the truncated-type mutations have no such effect (Figure 3B). This difference is important, because normal AML1 protein is expected to be expressed in MDS/AML cells because the normal allele for AML1 gene is usually retained. On the other hand, 2 missense mutations, His58Asn and Gly42Arg, bind DNA even more avidly than wild-type AML1 and enhance thetrans-activation potential of normal AML1 (Osato et al8 and Figure 3B). These somewhat puzzling findings could be explained by the choice of promoter in the reporter assay, because M-CSFR is unlikely to be the true target gene of AML1 mutants in the transformation process of hematopoietic progenitors. Alternatively, subtle dysregulation of the trans-activation activity of AML1, even up-regulation or down-regulation, might provide a growth advantage to hematopoietic cells. In this regard, 2 silent mutations (Thr101syn, Pro157syn) identified in this study would have pathologic significance. Although they may most simply be taken to represent a polymorphism, we did not find any other silent mutations among more than 300 samples. Thus, we assumed that these mutations might somehow affect the expression levels of AML1 protein through a posttranscriptional mechanism.  Because no mutations were detected in the C-terminal portion of AML1 (amino acid 178 to 453) in previous studies,8 11 we initially limited our SSCP analysis to the RHD. However, if subtle alteration of AML1 function could result in leukemogenic potential, mutations may exist also in the C-terminal portion that mediatestrans-activating potential. Indeed, a substantial number of nonsense or insertion/deletion mutations were found in the C-terminal portion (amino acid 215 to 507) of AML3/RUNX2/CBFA1, another member of the Runx transcription factor family that shares the RHD, in patients with a hereditary bone disease, cleidocranial dysplasia, which is caused by mutation of AML3 mainly in the RHD (Otto et al37). Thus, we extended our efforts to detect mutations in the C-terminal portion of AML1 in AML/MDS patients. We found a few patients with insertion/deletion mutants that resulted in frameshift mutations, although no mutations were found in A-bomb survivors (data not shown). Careful functional analysis of mutations in theAML1 gene should be performed to clarify these unsolved questions using in vitro and in vivo experimental systems. To develop the latter, mice carrying mutated AML1 genes are currently being established in our laboratory.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;Introduction  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal stem-cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and susceptibility to leukemic transformation (MDS/acute myelogenous leukemia [AML]). Progression from MDS-refractory anemia with excess blasts (MDS-RAEB) to AML is frequently observed in the clinical course, which is thought to result from serial acquisition of cytogenetic abnormalities.1â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“5 According to the 2-hit model of leukemogenesis, one class of mutations (class I), including FLT3-ITD, N-Ras, or K-Ras mutations, confers on cells a proliferative advantage; a second class of mutations (class II), including AML1/ETO, PML/RARÎ±, or MLL-related fusion genes, interferes with hematopoietic differentiation.6 Indeed, it has been reported that a combination of class I and II mutations such as FLT3-ITD plus AML1-ETO or MLL-SEPT6 induced AML in a mouse bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model, while either class I or II mutations alone led to, if anything, myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), not leukemia.6â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“13 On the other hand, the precise molecular mechanism underlying development of MDS and MDS/AML remains elusive partly because there are only a few mouse models for MDS and MDS/AML available. So far, 2 distinct models of MDS have been reported: Evi1 induced MDS-like symptoms in a mouse BMT model in which the mice succumbed to fatal peripheral cytopenia,14 while NUP98-HOXD13 transgenic mice developed MDS and died of either various types of acute leukemia or severe anemia and leukocytopenia.15 In the present study, we generated a mouse BMT model of MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML induced by AML1 mutants frequently found in patients with MDS and MDS/AML. Interestingly, the phenotypes of these mice very much resemble those of the human diseases.  The AML1 gene is located on chromosome 21q22 and is the most frequent target for chromosomal translocation in leukemia. Analysis of AML1-deficient mice has shown that AML1 is indispensable for the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis.16â‡“â€“18 As accumulated studies have demonstrated, heterozygous germline mutations in the AML1 gene caused familial platelet disorder with predisposition to AML (FPD/AML),19,20 and sporadic point mutations were frequently found in the development of leukemia: 21% of AML M0, 15.0% to 15.9% of MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML, and 46% of radiation-associated MDS.21â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“29 The vast majority of AML1 mutations were located in the Runt homology domain (RHD), which mediated its ability to bind to DNA and core-binding factor Î² (CBFÎ²). To confirm the involvement of AML1 mutations in hematopoietic disorders, we selected 2 types of AML1 mutants found in patients with MDS/AML: one with a point mutation in RHD (AML1-D171N), and the other with C-terminal truncation caused by a frame-shift (AML1-S291fsX300). After transplantation using bone marrow cells infected with retrovirus vectors harboring AML1 mutants, most of the mice that received transplants died of MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML. Long-term analysis demonstrated that the phenotype of the mice that underwent transplantation depended on the kind of AML1 mutants used in this study and on the integration sites of retroviruses. Considering the recent reports of the effects of retrovirus integration sites on biological results,30â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“38 identification of integration sites may lead to the discovery of the genes involved in the induction of MDS/AML in concert with AML1 mutants. Intriguingly, the enhanced expression of Evi1 by retrovirus integration seemed to collaborate with AML1-D171N to induce MDS/AML with the same phenotype. Moreover, we confirmed that combination of AML1-D171N and Evi1 induced AML of the same phenotype with shorter latencies in the mouse BMT model. This model will allow valuable insight into the molecular pathogenesis of MDS and MDS/AML.  Methods  Vector construction  We used 2 AML1 mutants, D171N or S291fsX300, identified from case no. 5 or 27, respectively, among patients with MDS/AML.25,26 These mutants are hereafter referred to as AML1-D171N and AML1-S291fs. AML1 wild-type (WT; AML1b), AML1-D171N, or AML1-S291fs, which was fused with a FLAG epitope tag at the N-terminus, was inserted upstream of the IRES-EGFP cassette of pMYs-IG to generate pMYs-AML1 WT, D171N, or S291fs-IG, respectively. pMYs-mouse Evi1-IG were kindly provided by Dr T. Nakamura (The Cancer Institute, Tokyo, Japan).38  Transfection and retrovirus production  Plat-E39 packaging cells maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) were transfected with retroviral constructs by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations. The medium was changed 1 day after the transfection, and retroviruses were harvested 48 hours after the transfection as previously described.39,40 Titers of the retroviruses were assessed based on the number of neomycin-resistant colonies of the infected NIH3T3 cells (average: 107 infection U/mL) as described.39  Mouse BMT  Bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated from the femurs and tibias of C57BL/6 (Ly-5.1) donor mice (9-12 weeks of age) 4 days after intraperitoneal administration of 150 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cultured overnight in Î± minimal essential medium (Î±MEM) supplemented with 20% FCS and 50 ng/mL of mouse stem cell factor (SCF), mouse FLT3 ligand (FL), human IL-6, and human thrombopoietin (TPO; R&amp;amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The prestimulated cells were infected for 60 hours with the retroviruses harboring pMYs-AML1 WT, D171N, or S291fs-IG, or an empty vector as a control, using 6-well dishes coated with RetroNectin (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations. Then, 0.2 to 3.5 Ã— 106 of infected bone marrow cells (Ly-5.1) were injected through tail vein into C57BL/6 (Ly-5.2)â€“recipient mice (8-12 weeks of age) which had been administered a sublethal dose of 5.25 Gy or a lethal dose of 9.5 Gy total-body Î³-irradiation (135Cs). For the lethally irradiated mice, a radioprotective dose of 2 Ã— 105 of bone marrow cells (Ly-5.2) was simultaneously injected. Probabilities of overall survival of the mice that received transplants were estimated using the Kaplan-Meiermethod. All animal studies were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo.  Analysis of the mice that underwent transplantation  Engraftment of bone marrow cells infected with retroviruses was confirmed by measuring the percentage of GFP+ and Ly-5.1+ cells in peripheral blood obtained every 1 to 2 months after the transplantation.  After the morbid mice were killed, their tissue samples, including peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), spleen, liver, and kidney, were analyzed. Circulating blood cells were counted by an analyzer. Morphology of the peripheral blood was evaluated by staining of air-dried smears with Hemacolor (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E). Cytospin preparations of bone marrow and spleen cells were also stained with Hemacolor. Percentage of blasts, myelocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and erythroblasts was estimated by examination of at least 200 cells. To assess whether the leukemic cells were transplantable, 2 Ã— 105 to 106 total BM cells including blasts were injected into the tail veins of sublethally irradiated mice. A total of 2 or 3 recipient mice were used for each serial transplantation.  Flow cytometric analysis  Red blood cells were lysed by using Ammonium Chloride Lysing Reagent (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) in PB or single-cell suspensions of bone marrow and spleen. Washed cells were incubated for 15 minutes at 4Â°C with 2.4G2 antibody for blocking and then stained for 20 minutes at 4Â°C with the following monoclonal phycoerythrin (PE)â€“conjugated antibodies: Ly-5.1, Gr-1, CD11b, B220, CD3, CD41, c-Kit, Sca-1, CD34, and Ter119. Flow cytometric analysis of the stained cells was performed with FACSCalibur flow (BD Biosciences) equipped with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences) and Flowjo software (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA).  Diagnosis  Diagnosis was made according to the Bethesda proposals for classification of nonlymphoid hematopoietic neoplasms in mice.41  Real-time RT-PCR  Total RNA was extracted from BM cells using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA was prepared with the Superscript II RT kit (Invitrogen). Real-time reverse transcriptionâ€“polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using a LightCycler Workflow System (Roche Diagnostics). cDNA was amplified using a SYBR Premix EX Taq (TAKARA). Reaction was subject to one cycle of 95Â°C for 30 seconds, 45 cycles of PCR at 95Â°C for 5 seconds, 55Â°C for 10 seconds, and 72Â°C for 10 seconds. All samples were independently analyzed at least 3 times. The following primer pairs were used: 5â€²-CCAGATGTCACATGACAGTGGAAAGCACTA-3â€² (forward) and 5â€²-CCGGGTTGGCATGACTCATATTAACCATGG-3â€² (reverse) for Evi1; 5â€²-TACCTCAACCCCTGACAGCTATGG-3â€² (forward) and 5â€²-TCGGTTGGAGATATCAGAGTGCAG-3â€² (reverse) for MN1;42 and 5â€²-GTTATCCCATCTGCATCAGCATCTGG-3â€² (forward) and 5â€²-GGTCCTCTTCACTCTTCATGAACAGC-3â€² (reverse) for MDS1/Evi1.43 Relative gene expression levels were calculated using standard curves generated by serial dilutions of cDNA. Product quality was checked by melting curve analysis via LightCycler software (Roche Diagnostics). Expression levels were normalized by a control, the expression level of GAPDH mRNA.  Western blot analysis  To detect the expression of AML1 WT, mutants, or Evi1, equal numbers of spleen cells were lysed, and Western blotting was performed as described with minor modifications.13 Polyclonal rabbit anti-Evi1 antibody (a kind gift from Dr M. Kurokawa, Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan), or a monoclonal mouse anti-Flag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was used for Evi1 or AML1, respectively.  Southern blot analysis  Genomic DNA was extracted from BM or spleen cells. After enzymatic digestion of 10 Î¼g DNA with EcoRI followed by electrophoretic separation, proviruses were probed with a GFP probe.  Bubble PCR  A total of 10 Î¼g of genomic DNA extracted from BM or spleen cells was digested with EcoRI, and the fragments were ligated overnight at 16Â°C to a double-stranded bubble linker (5â€²-AATTGAAGGAGAGGACGCTGTCTG-TCGAAGGTAAGGAACGGACGAGAGAAGGGAGAG-3â€² and 5â€²-GACTC-TCCCTTCTCGAATCGTAACCGTTCGTACGAGAATCGCTGTCCTCTCC-TTC-3â€²).44 Next, PCR was performed on the ligation product using a linker-specific Vectorette primer (5â€²-CGAATCGTAACCGTTCGTACGAGAATCGCT-3â€²)44,45 and a long-terminal repeat (LTR)â€“specific primer (5â€²-CGAGCTCAATAAAAGAGCCCACAACCCC-3â€²) under the following conditions: one cycle of 95Â°C for 5 minutes, 10 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 seconds, and 67Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 3 minutes, 10 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 seconds, and 67Â°C (this annealing temperature was reduced by 1Â°C each cycle) for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 3 minutes, 15 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 seconds and 57Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 3 minutes, and one cycle of 72Â°C for 90 seconds. Next, nested PCR was performed on 2 Î¼L of PCR products using a linker-specific Vectorette primer and an LTR-specific primer (5â€²-ATAAAAGAGCCCACAACCCCTCACTCGG-3â€²) under the following conditions: 1 cycle of 95Â°C for 5 minutes, 35 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 seconds and 60Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 3 minutes, and 1 cycle of 72Â°C for 90 seconds. The PCR product was electrophoresed using 1.0% agarose gel. Individual bands were excised and purified using PCR clear (Promega, Madison, WI) and were sequenced to identify the integration site of retrovirus. We confirmed inverse repeat sequence â€œGGGGGTCTTTCAâ€� as a marker of junction between genomic DNA and retrovirus sequence.  Results  The ratio of AML1 mutant-transduced cells gradually increased over several months after transplantation  To examine the effect of AML1 mutants on the hematopoietic abnormality, we chose 2 distinct mutants, AML1-D171N and AML1-S291fsX300, which are found in patients with MDS/AML.25,26 The former has a point mutation in RHD, and the latter possesses a frameshift mutation in the C-terminal region, resulting in truncation of the authentic protein (Figure 1A). Ly-5.1 murine BM cells infected with retroviruses harboring AML1 WT, AML1-D171N, AML1-S291fsX300, or empty vector were transplanted into irradiated syngeneic Ly-5.2 mice. In most of mice that received transplants of AML1-D171Nâ€“ or S291fsX300-transduced cells (hereafter referred to as mice/D171N or mice/S291fs, respectively), the ratio of GFP+ and Ly-5.1+ cells gradually increased over several months after the transplantation (Figure 1B), but not in mice that received transplants of AML1 WT-transduced cells or control retrovirus-infected cells (hereafter referred to as mice/WT or mice/mock, respectively). Gradual increase of c-kit+ cells in the PB was also observed in the mice that received transplants of AML1 mutant-transduced cells during the observation period (Figure 1C). Cells positive for c-kit and GFPâ€”that is, c-kit+ cells transduced with AML1 mutantsâ€”were morphologically blasts with high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratios (data not shown). In fact, the percentage of blasts gradually increased in the PB of the mice that received transplants of AML1 mutant-transduced cells, especially the mice/D171N. Finally, most of mice/D171N or mice/S291fs became sick and died with latencies of 4 to 13 months after the transplantation, while mice/mock were healthy over the observation period (Figure 1D). Overall survival of mice/D171N was not significantly different from that of mice/S291fs (P = .218). Expression of the transduced AML1-D171N or AML1-S291fs in spleen cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Figure 2A). Two of the mice/WT died during the observation period. BM of the 2 mice was occupied with GFP/Ly5.1 double-negative cells. One of the mice/WT developed leukemia derived from recipient cells at 272 days after transplantation. The remaining one mouse/WT died of anemia with unknown reason at 355 days after transplantation.

As a positive control, Plat-E packaging cells were transduced with mock (lane 1), AML1 WT (lane 2), AML1-D171N (lane 3), or AML1-S291fs (lane 4). Spleen cells were derived from mice/D171N (lanes 5-8), mice/S291fs (lanes 9-11), mice/WT (lane 12), mice/mock (lane 13), or control normal mouse (lane 14). White arrows indicate transduced AML1 WT, AML1-D171N, and AML1-S291fs. (B) AML1 WT-transduced cells were undetectable in PB at 1 month after the transplantation. Flow cytometric analysis of PB obtained from mice that received transplants of AML1-D171N, AML1-S291fs, AML1 WT, and mock at 1 month after transplantation. Interestingly, in the peripheral blood of mice/WT, GFP+ cell counts were extremely low 1 month after transplantation and thereafter became undetectable, despite the fact that 14% to 27% of the BM cells were positive for GFP before transplantation (Figures 1B,2B; Table S1, available on the Blood website; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article). Consistently, the expression of transduced AML1 WT was not detected in spleen cells of mice/WT (Figure 2A; mouse ID: 105). These data suggested that forced expression of AML1 WT in the stem cells had a negative effect on the survival and expansion of these cells in the BM. Recently, Tsuzuki et al reported that expression of the full-length isoform AML1b abrogated engraftment potential of murine long-term reconstituting stem cells in a mouse BMT model.46 Their result coincides with our result.  AML1-D171N and AML1-S291fs induced different diseases in mice that underwent transplantation  PB cell counts were different between mice/D171N and mice/S291fs; most mice/D171N (Figure 3A; lanes 1,2) showed leukocytosis, while mice/S291fs (Figure 3A; lane 3) showed leukocytopenia. This difference was significant (P = .007). Macroscopic observation of morbid mice revealed that severe hepatosplenomegaly was exclusively found in mice/D171N, but not in mice/S291fs (Figure 3E,F; Table S2).

Statistical differences were determined by 2-sample t test with Welch correction (*P &amp;lt; .05; **P &amp;lt; .01). Lane 1: mice/D171N without high expression of Evi1 in BM or not examined due to the lack of bone marrow samples (WBC, PLT, Hg, and MCV: n = 11; spleen: n = 5; and liver: n = 4). Lane 2: mice/D171N with high expression of Evi1 (n = 11). Lane 3: mice/S291fs (WBC, PLT, Hg, and MCV: n = 9; spleen and liver: n = 8). Lane 4: mice/WT (WBC, PLT, Hg, and MCV: n = 10; spleen and liver: n = 4). Lane 5: mice/mock (WBC, PLT, Hg, and MCV: n = 12; spleen: n = 6; and liver: n = 5). The smear specimens of peripheral blood were obtained every 1 to 2 months. The specimens showed that most of mice/D171N and mice/S291fs suffered from multilineage dysplasia characteristic of MDS. Erythroid dysplasia such as Howell-Jolly bodies, red cell polychromasia, and poikilocytosis (Figure 4A) were frequently detected in both mice. In BM specimens of morbid mice, orthochromatic giant erythroblasts and karyorrhexis were detected (Figure 4B). Erythroid dysplasia was more evident in mice/S291fs than in mice/D171N. As recently described in a mouse MDS model,15 increase of red blood cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was also observed in most mice/D171N and mice/S291fs (Figure 3D; Table S2). Myeloid dysplasia such as the pseudoâ€“Pelger-Huet anomaly (Figure 4C) was frequently detected in mice/D171N. Hypersegmented neutrophils (Figure 4D) and giant platelets (Figure 4F) were observed in 2 mice/D171N (mouse IDs 9 and 17). Collectively, AML1 mutants used in this study induced multilineage dysplasia, in particular in erythroid and myeloid lineages. Continuous pancytopenia was observed in 7 of 8 morbid mice/S291fs and 2 of 16 morbid mice/D171N, although BM of the morbid mice was not hypocellular but hypercellular or normocellular. Based on these findings, a final diagnosis was made by the ratio of blasts in the bone marrow according to the Bethesda proposals for classification of nonlymphoid hematopoietic neoplasms in mice.41 As a result, MDS/AML was recognized in 13 of 16 morbid mice/D171N and in 5 of 8 morbid mice/S291fs, while MDS-RAEB was recognized in 2 of 16 morbid mice/D171N and 2 of 8 morbid mice/S291fs (Table S2). One mouse/D171N was diagnosed with AML at 4 months after transplantation because we did not examine to see if the MDS phase had preceded AML (mouse ID 5). The leukemic cells derived from either mice/D171N or mice/S291fs were serially transplantable. We confirmed the serial transplantability in 11 mice/D171N (mouse IDs 4, 6, 9, 12-15, 17, 20, 22, and 26) and 6 mice/S291fs (mouse IDs 52, 54-56, 58, and 60). Penetrance of serial transplantation was 100%, except for mouse IDs 9 and 17; that is, 33% and 50%, respectively. Mice that underwent serial transplantation showed more aggressive status than primary mice and died with shorter latencies. Hematologic parameters of mice that underwent serial transplantation are shown in Table S3.

In summary, the pattern and degree of multilineage dysplasia differed among the mice that underwent transplantation. Although both mice/D171N and mice/S291fs died of MDS and MDS/AML within 4 to 13 months after transplantation, a marked difference existed in terms of clinical symptoms, including hematopoietic or macroscopic findings.  A distinct type of disease was identified in mice/D171N  Among the mice that underwent transplantation transduced with AML1-D171N, a distinct group was identified. GFP+ BM cells in 11 of 16 morbid mice/D171N (mouse IDs 4, 6, 7, 12-15, 19, 20, 22, and 26) displayed a similar phenotype, with high percentages of CD11b+ and B220+ cells (Figure 5; data not shown). All these mice/D171N showed dysplasia in myeloid and erythroid lineages for several months and died of MDS/AML with increased number of blasts, anemia, and, in some cases, thrombocytopenia (Table S2). These mice/D171N also showed severe hepatosplenomegaly (Figures 3E,F, 6A; Table S2), and histologic examination showed expansion of blasts and immature myeloid cells in the PB, BM, and spleen, and the invasion of these cells into hepatic portal areas in the liver and spaces among renal tubules in the kidney (Figure 6B,D,F). Giemsa staining of BM showed a high percentage of blasts (Figure 6H), in accordance with a high percentage of both GFP/c-kit double-positive cells by flow cytometolic analysis.

In contrast, the remaining 4 morbid mice/D171N diagnosed as MDS (mouse IDs 9 and 11) or MDS/AML (mouse IDs 10 and 17) showed heterologous phenotypes of GFP+ BM cells (data not shown). Although mouse IDs 9 and 17 displayed hepatosplenomegaly like other mice/D171N, they exhibited leukocytopenia with fewer blasts.  AML1-D171N collaborated with Evi1 in inducing MDS/AML  We then asked why even the same point mutant of AML1 caused different phenotypes of MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML. We assumed the possibility that the integration of retroviruses influenced the outcomes in the BMT model. To explore this, we first performed Southern blot analysis of BM of the morbid mice. A single or several proviral integrations were confirmed (Figure 7A). Next, we used the bubble PCR method to identify the integrated sites.7,44,45 A single or 2 integration sites were identified in each sample (Table 1). Interestingly, integrations near Evi1 site were found in 7 of 15 genomic DNA samples of BM cells derived from mice/D171N, but not from mice/S291fs. Moreover, retrospective examination revealed that these 7 mice presented nearly identical phenotypes, characterized by marked hepatosplenomegaly (Figure 6A), leukocytosis (Figure 3A), and biphenotypic surface markers (CD11b+ and B220+) of the leukemic cells (Figure 5), thus constituting a definite subgroup among mice/D171N. Southern blot analysis showed that all of the leukemic mice with high expression of Evi1 are monoclonal (except for mouse IDs 15 and 19), but the other leukemic mice without high expression of Evi1 are oligoclonal or have several integrations (Figure 7A). Noteworthy was the finding that the Evi1 site was not identified from the genomic DNA samples of mice/S291fs, even though the Evi1 site is a known common integration site of retroviruses.31â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“38 These led us to postulate that Evi1 collaborated with AML1-D171N in inducing the distinct type of MDS/AML. To test this, we examined whether the expression of Evi1 was enhanced in the BM cells in which the integration into an Evi1 site was identified. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of Evi1 were high in all the related samples (Figure 7C). Protein expression levels corresponded to mRNA expression levels of Evi1 (Figure 7D; data not shown). Interestingly, 4 samples derived from mice/D171N harboring no integration near Evi1 also displayed significantly high expression levels of Evi1 (mouse IDs 13, 19, 20, and 22), and the phenotypes of these mice were identical to those induced by AML1-D171Nâ€“transduced cells in which retroviruses were integrated into the Evi1 site. In these cases, the expression of Evi1 might have been enhanced secondarily by an unknown mechanism, or we simply failed to detect the integration site. The latter possibility was supported by the fact that multiple integrations were detected in these cases (Figure 7A; mouse IDs 13, 19, and 20). In any case, all the mice/D171N with enhanced expression of Evi1 in their BM cells displayed high percentages of blasts (Figure S1). We also examined whether the expression of MDS1/Evi1 was enhanced by the integration into an Evi1 site. The MDS1 gene is located approximately 240 kb upstream of Evi1, and MDS1/Evi1 is generated from the in-frame splicing of MDS1 to the second exon of Evi1.36,43 Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of MDS1/Evi1 were low and were not significantly increased when compared with controls (data not shown). The integration sites of Evi1 were focused on two regions (Table 1). One is 15 kb upstream of start site of Evi1 (mouse IDs 12, 14, 15), and another is 107 kb upstream of start site of Evi1 (mouse IDs 4, 6, 7, 26). Morishita et al reported that the retrovirus integrations had occurred near or in 5â€² noncoding exons of Evi1 gene.31 The integration site at 15 kb upstream of the start site of Evi1 that we found is near to the site they reported.

(C) Real-time PCR for Evi1 in BM derived from morbid mice/D171N or mice/S291fs or mice/WT or mice/mock. In addition to 6 samples from mice/D171N harboring integration near Evi1 (mouse IDs 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, and 15), 4 samples derived from mice/D171N without integration near Evi1 display high expression levels of Evi1 (mouse IDs 13, 19, 20, and 22). RNA from normal BM cells served as a control (RNA level = 1). (D) Western blot of lysates from spleen cells of mice/D171N, mice/WT, and normal mice and PLAT-E as controls. Samples from mice/D171N confirmed high expression of Evi1 by RT-PCR showed expression of the protein (mouse IDs 6, 15, 20, and 22), but the other mice without high expression of Evi1 by RT-PCR did not express the protein (mouse IDs 11, 17, and 105). View inlineView popup Table 1 Analysis of integration site In vivo collaboration between Evi1 and AML1-D171N  Next, we tested to see if Evi1 expression collaborates with AML1-D171N in inducing leukemia in the BMT model. Cotransduction of AML1-D171N and Evi1 into BM cells resulted in rapid induction of the disease in the mice that underwent transplantation that was essentially identical with the disease that developed after a long latency in the mice/D171N (Figures 1E,5). In fact, all the mice displayed increased number of blasts in the PB within a month after the transplantation of BM cells transduced with Evi1/D171N. Southern blot analysis showed that these leukemic cells were polyclonal (Figure 7B). These results indicate that AML1-D171N and Evi1 collaborate to induce MDS/AML with a distinct phenotype. On the other hand, cotransduction of AML1-S291fs and Evi1 into BM cells did not induce MDS/AML in 5 months (data not shown). In the present work, mice that received transplants of BM cellâ€“transduced Evi1 alone did not present any abnormalities in 5 months (Figure 1E).  AML1-S291fs induced erythroid dysplasia with pancytopenia  In contrast to mice/D171N, most of mice/S291fs displayed remarkable erythroid dysplasia with continuous pancytopenia (Figures 3A-C,4A). A total of 2 of 8 mice/S291fs died of MDS-RAEB in which the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow was less than 20%, and 5 mice/S291fs developed MDS/AML. The mice displayed severe anemia but not leukocytosis in the PB, and the numbers of blasts were generally lower than those of MDS/AML mice transduced with AML1-D171N (Table S2). Surface markers of leukemic cells derived from mice/S291fs were different from those of mice/D171N (Figure S3).  We found integrations of the retrovirus in the intron of MN1 in 3 of 8 mice/S291fs (Table 1; mouse IDs 55, 56, and 58), and MN1 was overexpressed in the leukemic cells of these mice (Figure S2). The integration site was identical among these leukemic cells, indicating that leukemic cells of the 3 mice were derived from a single hematopoietic progenitor and that overexpression of MN1 induced expansion of the transduced stem cells during the 3-day culture period before the transplantation. Indeed, the mice with the integration at that MN1 site developed MDS/AML with shorter latencies (Table S2).  Discussion  We have established a mouse BMT model for MDS and MDS/AML using AML1 mutants derived from patients with MDS, although previous studies either using similar BMT models or knock-in mice of AML1 mutants failed to do so. There are several potential explanations for this discrepancy. First, because most AML1 mutants work as dominant-negative forms, high expression levels of the mutants would be critical to effectively inhibit WT AML1. In this aspect, our BMT model has an advantage, using the efficient retrovirus vector pMYs40 designed to achieve high expression in hematopoietic progenitor cells and, unlike most other retrovirus vectors, harbors splice donor and acceptor sites derived from the MFG vector to increase expression levels.40,47 Second, using the efficient packaging cell line Plat-E,39 we achieved high titers of retroviruses (average: 107 infection U/mL), which could result in the higher numbers of retrovirus integrations. This also increases the probabilities of up-regulating or disrupting important genes that collaborate with AML1 mutants in inducing MDS and/or MDS/AML. Alternatively, it is also possible that the positions of AML1 mutations are critical for the biological effect. We believe that the combination of these factors has put our system into practice.  In the present MDS model, we used 2 AML1 mutants, D171N and S291fsX300. The latter, a C-terminalâ€“truncated form, is more potent as a dominant-negative form than the former, which harbors a point mutation in the RHD.25,26 In this context, it is reasonable that the S291fs mutant induced the disease in the mice that underwent transplantation with a higher penetrance (Figure 1D). More important, expression of these mutants induced MDS/AML of distinct phenotypes in the mice that underwent transplantation: AML1-S291fs induced pancytopenia associated with dysplasia in the erythroid lineage, while AML1-D171N frequently induced hepatoslenomegaly and leukocytosis associated with marked myeloid dysplasia. This suggests that even different mutations of the same gene could induce heterogeneous diseases. As previously described,25,26 AML1-D171N lost DNA-binding ability and hence transactivation potential because it possessed a point mutation in RHD essential for DNA-binding, while AML1-S291fs had increased DNA-binding ability but lost transactivation potential because it had an intact RHD but lacked a C-terminal transactivation domain. Thus, the different biological outcomes induced by AML1 mutants could be explained in part by structural and functional differences between the mutants. In addition to the dominant-negative functions, these mutants may also have gain of function; the fact that AML1-KO mice did not develop leukemia18 indicates that deletion of AML1 alone is not sufficient to induce leukemia, suggesting the possibility that the AML1 mutants have gain of function as well. Because AML1 associates and forms a ternary complex with other transcriptional factors and cofactors via its specific domains, it is possible that these mutants exert different effects on the proliferation and differentiation of BM cells in the various contexts.  In BMT models using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, the genes near the retrovirus integration sites are thought to affect the outcomes.30â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“38 This sometimes obscures the significance of the transduced gene, but simultaneously will give us clues to understanding the collaboration of multiple genes in the development of leukemias. One of the intriguing findings of the present work is that high expression of Evi1, either caused by virus integration or by unknown mechanisms, was able to collaborate with AML1-D171N in inducing the homogeneous disease characterized by leukocytosis, severe myelodysplasia, and marked hepatosplenomegaly that always developed to overt leukemia with high percentages of B220+ and CD11b+ blasts. Together with the recent findings that Evi1 expression was observed in patients with MDS and AML,36,48 and that Evi1 alone did not induce AML in mouse models,14,34,49,50 our result strongly suggested that AML1-D171N collaborated with Evi1 in inducing MDS/AML. It is interesting to note that AML1-S291fs never collaborated with Evi1 during our examination (Table 1), again suggesting that these 2 AML1 mutations transform hematopoietic cells through distinct mechanisms. Importantly, we confirmed the collaboration between AML1-D171N and Evi1 in an in vivo experiment. Cotransduction of AML1-D171N and Evi1 into BM cells resulted in rapid induction of MDS/AML in the mice that received transplants. In addition, the leukemic cells in most of these mice included more clones than those in mice/D171N (Figure 7B), indicating cooperation of Evi1 and AML1-D171N. However, leukemic cells from one mouse (ID 305) seemed to be monoclonal and to contribute to oligoclonal leukemia of mouse 304. In addition, it took 2 to 3 months for leukemias induced by the combination of AML1-D171N and Evi1 to kill the mice that received transplants. Together, these result suggested that while AML1-D171N and Evi1 overexpression collaborated in inducing leukemia, additional steps were required for efficient transformation of hematopoietic progenitors. In the absence of Evi1 high expression, AML1-D171N caused MDS or MDS/AML with low percentages of blasts in BM but still with hepatosplenomegaly. This indicates that hepatosplenomegaly had something to do with AML1-D171N.  In contrast to mice/D171N, most mice/S291fs succumbed to either MDS-RAEB with fatal severe anemia following continuous pancytopenia or MDS/AML without leukocytosis. The integration site in the intron 1 of the MN1 gene found in leukemic cells of 3 mice was derived from the same cell. We also found that MN1 was overexpressed in the leukemic cells of these mice, suggesting that overexpression of MN1 induced effective expansion of leukemic stem cells. Recently, Heuser et al reported that high expression of MN1 correlated with poor outcome in AML with normal cytogenetics.51 Moreover, Slape et al identified MN1 as potential collaborators of NUP98/HOXD13 to induce leukemia.42 Further work will be required to investigate the role of MN1 in MDS/AML.  One fundamental question of this study was whether AML1 mutants alone induce MDS and MDS/AML. In our experiments, 5 of the 6 surviving mice/D171N showed a disappearance of GFP+ cells in time, suggesting that AML1-D171N alone was not able to induce MDS/AML. Previous studies using gene-engineered mice and a BMT model demonstrated that AML1 fusions caused by chromosomal translocations alone were insufficient to induce AML,7â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“12 except for AML1-MDS1-Evi1, which by itself induced AML with a long latency.52 In addition, several lines of evidence30â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â‡“â€“38 that implicated the integration site of retroviruses for different biological outcomes led us to consider the same possibility in this BMT model. Indeed, we identified frequent retrovirus integrations near the Evi1 gene in the BM cells derived from mice/D171N whose leukemic cells displayed nearly identical phenotypes and concomitant elevated expression of Evi1. Importantly, coexpression of AML1-D171N and Evi1 induced the same leukemia with shorther latencies, demonstrating the collaboration between AML1-D171N and Evi1 in vivo. These results showed the power of in vivo insertional mutagenesis of retroviruses in a search for genes involved in the pathogenesis of MDS and MDS/AML.  Finally, it is important to relate these in vivo results to clinical data of the human disease. The recent finding25â‡“â€“27 that AML1 point mutations in the C-terminal regions were almost exclusively found in MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML, but not in de novo AML, coincided with our data that AML1-S291fs tended to induce MDS-RAEBâ€“like symptoms in this BMT model. Clinical findings25â‡“â€“27 that the RHD point mutation was often found in de novo AML, mainly AML M0, in addition to MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML, was also in accordance with our data that AML1-D171N induced more progressive MDS/AML with higher percentages of blasts when compared with AML1-S291fs. Classification of MDS and MDS/AML is always controversial because of the heterogeneity of the disease.1,2,27 In the future, this disease will be reclassified based on genetic alterations and their combinations.  In summary, we have generated a mouse BMT model of MDS-RAEB and MDS/AML. The current BMT model, mimicking AML1-related MDS, will be useful for understanding molecular pathogenesis and establishing new therapeutic strategy for MDS and MDS/AML.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;The Runt-related transcription factor 1 gene (RUNX1 aliases AML1, CBFA2 and PEBP2aB) belongs to a family of three evolutionarily conserved genes (RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3) that code for transcription factors involved in cell lineage differentiation during development [1,2]. The RUNX1 gene, located in chromosome 21q22.3, is crucial for the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis and the generation of hematopoietic stem cells in the embryo [1,3,4]. RUNX2, located in chromosome 6p21, is essential for osteogenesis and RUNX3, located in chromosome 1p36.1, plays a major role in neurogenesis and thymopoiesis [5,6]. Members of this family share a 128-amino acid region of high sequence homology, known as the â€˜Runt domainâ€™, first identified in the Drosophila runt gene. In addition to this â€˜Runt homology domainâ€™ (RHD), there is a 5-amino acid sequence, VWRPY, that is 100% conserved at the C-terminal end of each of the three gene products [5]. The Runt domain is responsible for heterodimerization with the core-binding factor-b (CBF-b or PEBP2b), to form a transcription factor, and for DNA binding [7]. The RUNX1 gene spans 260 kb and consists of 12 exons with two distinct promoters, each followed by the initiation codon ATG. The RUNX1 protein is composed of 453 amino acids and contains several regions of major importance (Figure 1) [2]. These are the RHDs coded by exons 3â€“5 and located in the N-terminal part (amino acids 50â€“177), the transcription activation domain (TAD; amino acids 243â€“371) coded by part of exon 7 and exon 8, the transcription inhibition domain (amino acids 372â€“411) and the VWRPY sequence. All three are located in the C-terminal region [8â€“12]. The two promoters, which are 160 kb apart, generate several alternatively spliced mRNAs differing in their types of 5Â´ and 3Â´ untranslated regions (UTRs) and their coding regions. Although at least 12 different RUNX1 mRNAs are generated, two splice variants are well characterized. The distal promotor-driven transcript, RUNX1b, codes for a 480-amino acid protein and the proximal promotor-driven transcript, RUNX1c, a 453-amino acid protein. The RHD is retained in both transcripts [5,13â€“15]. The fulllength coding regions harbor the C-terminal half of the protein, which regulates transcription [16]. A third splice variant, RUNX1a, codes for a protein that retains the RHD but lacks the TAD. This protein has a higher affinity for DNA binding and suppresses transcriptional activation of RUNX1b [17]. RUNX1 acts as a key regulator of hematopoiesis through the regulation of various hematopoietic genes, including growth factors (GM-CSF, MPO and IL-3), surface receptors (TCRA, TCRB, M-CSF receptor and FLT3), signaling molecules (CDKN1A, BLK and BCL2) and transcription activators (STAT3 and MYB) [2,18,19]. The RUNX1 protein acts as an activator or repressor of target gene expression depending upon the large number of transcription factors, coactivators and corepressors that interact with it. RUNX1 functions as an organizing protein that facilitates assembly of transcriptional activation or repression complexes (Figure 2). By recruitment of non-DNA binding proteins as p300/CBP and histone acetyltransferase (HAT), it contributes to the activation of transcription of target genes. Upon recruitment of non-DNA binding repressors such as mSin3A, Groucho/TLE and histone deacetylase (HDAC), it represses transcription of target genes [20â€“24]. RUNX1 translocations Some translocations involving RUNX1 have been shown to be frequent while others have only been reported in a few or single cases (Figure 3). At present, 55 partner chromosome bands have been described, but the partner gene has only been identified in 21 translocations at the molecular level (Table 1). Five translocations are known to be frequent in malignant hemopathies. They involve six different partner genes. The t(1;21)(p36;q22) translocation is a rare but recurrent translocation associated with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplasia (AML/MDS) [25â€“28]. It results in a RUNX1â€“PRDM16 (PR domain containing 16) fusion gene. The t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation is a recurrent rearrangement observed in patients with de novo or therapy-related AML, therapyrelated MDS and chronic myeloid leukemia in the blastic phase. This translocation is very often included in a complex karyotype and the prognosis is poor. Three genes have now been shown to fuse with RUNX1. These are RPL22L1 (alias EAP, ribosomal protein L22-like 1) and MECOM (MDS1 and EVI1 complex locus, previously known as MDS1 and EVI1 [ectropic viral integration site 1]) [29â€“34]. The t(8;21)(q22;q22), first described by Rowley in 1973 [35], was shown to involve the RUNX1T1 (aliases ETO, MTG8) gene in the early 1990s [36â€“38]. The RUNX1â€“RUNX1T1 fusion gene is identified in some 30% of the patients with AML-M2 subtype and is frequently associated with other cytogenetic abnormalities. Complete remission is achieved in the majority of patients, but relapse usually occurs within a few years [34,39,40]. The t(12;21)(p13;q22) is the most common structural chromosomal abnormality in pediatric common, or B-cell acute, lymphoblastic leukemia, accounting for approximately 20â€“25% of the cases. Complete remission is achieved in almost all the patients and the prognosis is very good, although late relapse is possible [41â€“43]. At the molecular level, this translocation fuses the 5Â´ region of ETV6 (alias TEL) with almost the entire coding region of RUNX1 [44,45]. First described by Raimondi et al. in 1989 in a case of AML subtype M1 [46], the t(16;21) (q24;q22) has now been reported in 20 patients, including 12 with AML-M2, 11 patients having had chemotherapy for a previous cancer [47,48]. This translocation was shown to induce the formation of a new chimeric gene involving the RUNX1 and CBFA2T3 (alias MTG16, core-binding factor, Runt domain, a subunit 2 translocated to 3) genes. There were 16 other partner genes or sequences identified in translocations associated with one or a few cases of malignant hemopathies (Table 1). The fusion genes that were characterized will be described elsewhere. A total of 33 translocations were also seldom reported (Table 2). In all these translocations, the RUNX1 gene was shown to be disrupted, presumably leading to the fusion of the RUNX1 gene with an as yet unidentified gene partner. However, in a few cases, these translocations involve a break point located in a band in which a partner gene has already been identified. This is true, for example, for translocations involving bands 1q21, 4q31 and 19q13. Whether these translocations involve an already known partner gene, or a different gene, remains to be determined. Unusual &amp;amp; complex rearrangements involving the RUNX1 gene Complex translocations involving three or four chromosomes and insertions have been reported in fewer than 100 cases (Table 3). All but two of the translocations in which both genes were identified, lead to the formation of a RUNX1â€“RUNX1T1 or a RUNX1â€“ETV6 fusion gene. Complex variant t(8;21) translocations have been reported in 6â€“10% of cases with RUNX1â€“RUNX1T1 fusion gene, the remaining patients having the classic t(8;21)(q22;q22) [40,49]. Compilation of six studies, totaling 214 patients with RUNX1â€“RUNX1T1 identified by real-time PCR (RT-PCR), real-time quantitative PCR or RNA-based PCR, demonstrates that 196 patients (91.6%) have the usual t(8;21)(q22;q22) whereas the remaining 18 patients (8.4%) have an unusual or complex rearrangement [50â€“55]. Among these latter patients, nine (4.2% of the 214 patients) have a three-way translocation, two (0.9%) a four-way translocation and seven (3.3%) an insertion. A literature search allowed us to retrieve 54 complex translocations involving the RUNX1 gene and band 8q22 (Table 3). The involvement of the RUNX1T1 gene was not searched for in ten cases; it was assumed that these translocations were variant t(8;21) translocations. Still, one cannot exclude the possibility that another gene located in band 8q22 was fused to RUNX1 (as we will see for band 3q26 elsewhere), or that the fusion occurred between a gene located on the third chromosome and RUNX1. The RUNX1â€“RUNX1T1 fusion gene was identified in the remaining 44 translocations. There were 38 three-way and six four-way translocations. Most of the three-way translocations could be recognized by conventional cytogenetics. However, in a few patients, the t(8;21) variants were â€˜maskedâ€™ as they appeared to involve chromosome 8 and a chromosome other than chromosome 21. However, in these cases, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), using dual-color AML1/ETO probe and/or RT-PCR, confirmed the involvement of both genes and the formation of a fusion gene [56â€“59]. All the chromosomes except chromosomes 7, 18, 22 and Y have been involved in complex translocations. Most of them were involved more than once, chromosomes 10 and 13 having been identified in five translocations each and chromosomes 1, 2 and 12 in four translocations each. However, even among these chromosomes, no band was found to be nonrandomly broken. In three-way translocations, up to three fusion genes can theoretically be generated, one fusing the 5Â´ region of RUNX1 with the 3Â´ region of RUNX1T1, the second fusing the 5Â´ region of RUNX1T1 with the 3Â´ part of another gene and the third fusing the 5Â´ part of this other gene with the 3Â´ region of RUNX1. Whether generation of these other fusion genes is associated with a more aggressive disease among patients with three-way translocation than those with the classic t(8;21) remains to be elucidated. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, no group has tried to identify these other fusion genes. However, one cannot exclude that some apparently complex translocations could be the result of two or more consecutive translocations. In such cases a standard RUNX1â€“RUNX1T1 fusion gene would be created, whereas the subsequent translocation(s) would involve loci close to, but different from, the RUNX1 and RUNX1T1 genes. A total of 15 chromosomal fragment insertions leading to RUNX1â€“RUNX1T1 fusion were also retrieved from the literature (Table 3). This includes the insertion of chromosome 21 material (including portions of the RUNX1 gene) into band 8q22 (six patients), or vice versa, the insertion of chromosomal material (including portions of RUNX1T1) into band 21q22 (nine patients). All the insertions of material from chromosome 21 into chromosome 8 were cryptic, although one was suspected on G-banded metaphases [51]. Some of the insertions of chromosome 8 material into chromosome 21 were identified by conventional cytogenetics because they involved larger chromosomal fragments [50,60,61]. Complex translocations involving chromosomes 12, 21 and another chromosome have been rarely reported [201]. In only three of them (two three-way and one four-way translocations), FISH using dual-color TEL-AML1 probe and/or RT-PCR confirmed the presence of the fusion gene [62â€“64]. Insertion is even rarer, only one case of insertion of 21q22 in band 12p13 with formation of the RUNX1â€“ETV6 fusion gene having been reported (Table 3) [65]. Structure &amp;amp; function of the fusion genes The fusion genes can be classified into five categories according to their structure and, as a consequence, to their function (Table 4). In addition, the same translocation can lead to different fusion products acting through different mechanisms. Indeed, alternate splicing transcripts have been reported in many fusion genes involving RUNX1, leading to in-frame fusion products with or without others leading to out-of-frame fusion products [27,66â€“73]. Furthermore, most studies have focused on the consequences of the chimeric proteins on the transcriptional activity of RUNX1, but few have analyzed the contributions of the fusion partners to leukemogenesis. However, there is now strong evidence that RUNX1 and its partner could cooperate to contribute to leukemogenesis using different pathways involving, for example, GATA and RAS [71,74,75]. Most of the chimeric genes involving RUNX1 fuse the 5Â´ part of the gene with the 3Â´ part of the partner gene. The RHD, located in the 5Â´ region of RUNX1, is retained in these fusion genes, but not the TAD situated in the 3Â´ part of the gene (Table 4). Several translocations also lead to truncated fusion genes retaining the RHD but not the TAD of RUNX1. These truncated RUNX1 gene products may compete with wildtype RUNX1 and act as dominant constitutive repressors inhibiting the function of the normal RUNX1 (Table 4). The RUNX1â€“PRDM16 fusion gene, obtained as the result of the t(1;21)(p36;q22) translocation, retains the RHD of RUNX1 and almost the entire PRDM16 gene [27,28]. Since the RUNX1â€“PRDM16 gene shares extensive homology with RUNX1â€“MECOM, it is likely that the RUNX1â€“PRDM16 protein acts in a similar way, as has been shown for the RUNX1â€“MECOM protein [28]. The translocation also generates a truncated RUNX1 transcript containing RHD [27,28]. The t(1;21)(p35â€“36.1;q22) translocation, described in a 68 year-old male with AML by Nguyen et al., leads to the formation of a RUNX1â€“YTHDF2 (YTH domain family member 2) transcript that includes the RHD, but not the TAD of RUNX1 [75]. The breakpoint occurs in intron 5 of the YTHDF2 gene that has six exons but is only translated from exons 1 to 5. Therefore, the fusion protein has a truncated RUNX1 protein without translating YTHDF2. The t(1;21)(q21;q22) translocation generates an in-frame chimeric RUNX1â€“ZNF687 (zinc finger protein 687) gene with the breakpoint located in intron 3 of the RUNX1 gene [75]. As a result, the fusion protein retains the first 57 amino acids of RUNX1, but only the first seven amino acids of the RHD, leading to a truncated and, presumably, nonfunctional RHD. This would prevent CBF-b and DNA binding and transcriptional activation of target genes involved in hematopoietic differentiation. Cytogenetic analysis of leukemic cells of a patient with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia revealed a t(2;21)(q13;q22) translocation. Molecular analysis revealed three RUNX1â€“AFF3 (alias LAF4, AF4/FMR2 family member) fusion transcripts, one in-frame, one out-of frame and one showing premature termination due to the insertion of an intronic sequence [76]. The breakpoints occurred in intron 7 of RUNX1 and all three retained the RHD. The t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation leads to the formation of, among others, a RUNX1- MECOM transcript that includes the RHD of RUNX1 and the two zinc-finger clusters of MECOM. The chimeric protein can accumulate PEBP2b in the nucleus more efficiently than the wild-type RUNX1, a mechanism contributing to leukemogenesis [77]. As a consequence, RUNX1â€“MECOM exerts a dominant negative effect over the wild-type RUNX1 in transcription activation, an antiapoptotic effect (owing to the first zinc-finger domain) and a proliferation stimulation effect (owing to the second zinc-finger domain) [29,31,78â€“80]. The RUNX1â€“RPL22L1 transcript, resulting from the t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation, includes the RHD of RUNX1 and the last 96 codons of RPL22L1. The fusion mRNA is terminated by an out-of-frame stop codon shortly after the junction between RUNX1 and RPL22L1 [29,30,81,82]. It is likely that the RUNX1â€“RPL22L1 protein acts as a negative inhibitor of the RUNX1 protein. The t(4;21)(q28;q22) translocation fuses the 5Â´ region of the RUNX1 gene (breakpoint in intron 6) to a 27 codon sequence of a novel gene named FGA7 (fused gene 7 to AML1) [69]. This rearrangement leads to a stop codon in the chimeric gene, resulting in a truncated RUNX1 protein possessing the RHD domain, but not the TAD. The t(4;21)(q31;q22) translocation, identified in one patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia, leads to the formation of an in-frame RUNX1â€“SH3D19 (Src homology 3 domain protein 19, also known as EEN-binding protein) transcript that includes the RHD of the RUNX1 gene and the full-length coding sequence of the SH3D19 gene [75]. The cryptic t(7;21)(p22;q22) translocation leads to the formation of a RUNX1â€“USP42 fusion gene that includes the RHD, part of the TAD of RUNX1 and almost the entire open-reading frame (except exon 1) of USP42 (ubiquitinspecific protease 42) gene. Unlike the other chimeric genes in which the breakpoint occurs 5Â´ to the TAD, in the RUNX1â€“USP42 fusion gene it occurs within the TAD; however, it is most likely nonfunctional because it is disrupted [72]. In the RUNX1â€“RUNX1T1 protein product generated by the t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation, the TAD of RUNX1, which normally binds the transcriptional coactivators p300-CBP, is replaced by almost the entire RUNX1T1. As a consequence, the fusion protein recruits a corepressor complex involving N-CoR, mSin3A, SMRT and HDACs instead of the coactivators p300-CBP. Therefore, the RUNX1â€“RUNX1T1 transcript functions as a transcriptional repressor of genes normally activated by RUNX1 [30,83â€“86]. Furthermore, genes, such as TIS11b (alias ERF-1), under the downstream control of the fusion protein are overexpressed and contribute to leukemogenesis [87]. The t(8;21)(q24;q22) translocation generates an in-frame chimeric gene that encodes a protein made of the N-terminal portion of RUNX1 (retaining the RHD) and the entire TRPS1. The TRPS1 (tricho-rhino-pharyngeal syndrome type I) gene encodes a nuclear transcription factor with ten zinc finger domains, including a GATA-type zinc finger [71]. Agerstam et al. described a t(9;21)(q34;q22) that generated a chimeric gene made of the first four exons of RUNX1 and repetitive sequences of a gene with unknown function. As a result, the fusion protein contained a truncated RHD and 70 amino acids from chromosome 9 ending with a stop codon [88]. Therefore, this truncated RUNX1 protein may compete with wild-type RUNX1 and act as a dominant constitutive repressor inhibiting the function of the normal RUNX1. The t(11;21)(q12;q22) translocation generates two in-frame chimeric transcripts from alternate splicing that encode proteins made of the N-terminal portion of RUNX1 (retaining the RHD) and the C-terminal of LPXN (leupaxin), a member of the paxillin superfamily of adaptor proteins [73]. LPXN is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells and negatively regulates B-cell receptor signaling [89,90]. Out-of-frame fusions, in which the RHD of RUNX1 is retained but an early stop codon occurs in the LPXN gene, are also generated. Two RUNX1-MACROD1 (alias LRP16, MACRO domain containing 1) fusion genes owing to alternate splicing were identified following molecular analysis of a t(11;21) (q13;q22) translocation [91]. Both retain the RHD of RUNX1 and the full-length coding sequence, but include exon 1 of MACROD1, a gene for which the precise biological function remains to be elucidated. At the molecular level, the t(12;21)(p13;q22) translocation fuses the 5Â´ region of ETV6 and the 3Â´ region of RUNX1 [44,45]. The ETV6â€“RUNX1 fusion gene retains the RHD and the TAD of RUNX1 as well as the promoter and the central repression domain of ETV6. The ETV6â€“RUNX1 fusion protein retains the ability to bind the RUNX1 target sequences and has the potential to function as a HDAC-dependent repressor, causing deregulation of the RUNX1 target genes [22,92,93]. Molecular analysis of a t(12;21)(q12;q22) translocation revealed an out-of-frame fusion of RUNX1 with the CPNE8 (Copine VIII) gene, resulting in translational termination after two amino acids of Copine VIII and, thus, a truncated RUNX1 protein. This truncated protein contained the RHD but not the TAD, the breakpoint having occurred in intron 6 of the RUNX1 gene [94]. The significant homology between CBFA2T3, fused to RUNX1 in the t(16;21)(q24;q22) translocation, and RUNX1T1 suggests that both RUNX1-CBFA2T3 and RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion genes have similar activity [68,95]. The RUNX1-CBFA2T3 protein is an altered transcriptional corepressor capable of recruitingThe t(19;21)(q13;q22) translocation fuses the 5Â´ end of the RUNX1 gene (breakpoint in intron 6) to a 236 nucleotide sequence on chromosome 19 termed AMP-19 [97]. This rearrangement leads to an out-of-frame fusion gene, resulting in a truncated RUNX1 protein bearing the RHD domain, but not the TAD. The rare t(X;21)(p22;q22) translocation leads to the formation of an in-frame RUNX1- PRDX4 transcript that includes the RHD of the RUNX1 gene. The PRDX4 gene, a member of the peroxiredoxin family, has a peroxidase activity, but is also involved in other cellular functions, including cell proliferation and differentiation [70]. Chan et al. described a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome associated with a t(X;21) (p22.3;q22) identified in conventional cytogenetics that was demonstrated, by FISH and molecular studies, to be a three-way translocation, t(X;8;21)(p22;q23;q22), leading to a RUNX1â€“ZFPM2 fusion gene [74]. The ZFPM2 gene (zinc finger protein, multitype 2, alias FOG2, friend of GATA-2) encodes a protein that retains the RHD of RUNX1 and the zinc fingers that interact with GATA proteins and the CtBP (corepressor C-terminal binding protein) interaction domain of ZFPM2. Two patients presenting with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia associated with a cryptic inv(21)(q21q22) were found to have a USP16- RUNX1 fusion transcript. In both cases, the transcript did not have an open reading frame and was made of the 3Â´ part of the USP16 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 16) gene and the 5Â´ part of RUNX1. Furthermore, the RHD coded by exons 3 to 5 of the RUNX1 gene is not preserved in the fusion protein [98]. Identification of two new partners of the RUNX1 gene Bone marrow and/or peripheral blood of patients with myeloid leukemia referred to the cytogenetics laboratory of the University Hospital in Brest are usually analyzed by FISH using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones in search of fusion genes involving the RUNX1 gene. This approach allowed us to identify a new partner gene in one case and to demonstrate in another case the complexity of rearrangements involving band 3q26 in which three RUNX1 partners have already been identified [99]. Analysis of a t(20;21)(q13;q22) Conventional cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood cell culture of a woman with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, identified a 47,XX,+8 karyotype in seven of the 19 cells studied. However, FISH analysis using the dual-color TEL-AML1 probe (Abbott, Rungis, France) showed disruption of the AML1 probe and localization of part of it on a small chromosome. As abnormalities of chromosome 20 are recurrently observed in CMML, 20p and 20q subtelomeric probes (Abbott) were applied. The analysis showed the 20q subtelomere to be translocated to the long arm of chromosome 21, signing the presence of a cryptic translocation involving bands 20q13 and 21q22, t(20;21)(q13;q22). Further FISH analyses were performed with BAC clones located on 20q and a clone (RP11â€“77G18) covering the RUNX1 gene [202]. Clones RP11â€“184L6 and RP11â€“135L8, normally located in band 20q13.2, were found to be split by the breakpoint. Hybridization with RP11â€“184L6 and RP11â€“77G18 showed colocalization of both signals, as the result of a probable fusion gene. BAC clones RP11â€“184L6 and RP11â€“135L8 contain the ZFP64 (zinc finger protein 64 homolog) gene; the protein coded by this gene could be involved in transcription regulation. Sakamoto et al. showed that the ZFP64 protein interacted with the intracellular domain of NOTCH1, a signaling protein having a major role in mesenchymal cell differentiation [100]. Furthermore, the expression of ZFP64 is under the control of RUNX2, belonging to the same gene family. Analysis of a t(3;21)(q26;q22) A complex translocation involving five chromosomes, which included both chromosomes 3, t(3;11;22;21;3)(p13;q14;q12;q22;q26), was identified in the bone marrow cells of a 51-yearold patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia without maturation (AML-M1, FAB classifi ca- FAB classification) at relapse following bone marrow trans- at relapse following bone marrow transplantation [99]. FISH analysis using the dualcolor TEL-AML1 probe showed disruption of the AML1 probe and translocation of part of it on chromosome 3, in band 3q26. Further FISH analyses were performed with BAC clones located on 3q26, some of them covering the MECOM complex locus and RPL22L1 gene already known to be fused with RUNX1 in (3;21) translocations, and a clone (RP11â€“77G18) covering the RUNX1 gene. In this case, the breakpoint occurred between clones RP11â€“434P20 and RP11â€“245C23 at 3q26, eight megabases distal to the MECOMRPL22L1 cluster, therefore arguing for the involvement of another gene. Three genes have been mapped in this interval between RP11â€“434P20 and RP11â€“245C23, including WIG1, a wild-type p53-induced gene [203]. This gene could be a good candidate to fuse with RUNX1 as it is located in the nucleus and contains three zinc finger domains and a putative nuclear localization signal. Unfortunately, no remaining material was available for further cytogenetic and molecular studies. This case illustrates the importance of always identifying the partner gene even when RUNX1 is involved in a â€˜recurrent translocation with known partner geneâ€™. Conclusion Most of the translocations involving RUNX1 lead to the formation of a fusion transcript made of the 5Â´ region of RUNX1, including the RHD but not the TAD, fused to the 3Â´ region of a partner gene, the breakpoints being concentrated in introns 5 and 6 of the RUNX1 gene (Figure 4). One exception is the RUNX1- ETV6 fusion gene, in which the 3Â´ sequences of RUNX1, including RHD and TAD, are fused to the 5Â´ region of ETV6, including its promotor. All the translocations that retain RHD but remove TAD have a leukemogenic effect by acting as dominant negative inhibitors of wild-type RUNX1 in transcription activation, mimicking the normal, but rare, RUNX1a splice variant which has higher affinity for DNA binding and suppresses the transcriptional activation of RUNX1b. Future perspective Given the crucial role of RUNX1 for the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis and generation of hematopoietic stem cells, it is expected that future studies will try to better understand its implication in normal hematopoiesis. Thus, this will provide more data on the leukemogenic effects of fusion genes involving RUNX1 and, possibly, give useful information on the phenotypic heterogeneity of leukemia associated with RUNX1 abnormalities. Much will be learned when currently unidentified genes are discovered, putting more insight into the mechanisms by which these partner genes and RUNX1 may cooperate in contributing to leukemogenesis using several different pathways. HDACs, thus repressing the expression of RUNX1 target genes [96].   Executive summary Normal function &amp;amp; structure of the RUNX1 gene n\\tRUNX1 has a crucial role in establishment of definitive hematopoiesis and generation of hematopoietic stem cells in the embryo. n\\tRUNX1 spans 260 kb and consists of 12 exons with two distinct promoters generating at least 12 different spliced mRNAs. n\\tRUNX1 acts as a key regulator of hematopoiesis through the regulation of various hematopoietic genes. n\\tThe RUNX1 protein has two major domains of biological significance: a Runt homology domain and a transcription activation domain. n\\tThe RUNX1 protein acts as activator or repressor of target gene expression.

       "      &lt;td&gt;The RUNX1/AML1 gene is the most frequent target for chromosomal translocation in leukemia. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated point mutations in the RUNX1 gene as another mode of genetic alteration in development of leukemia. Monoallelic germline mutations in RUNX1 result in familial platelet disorder predisposed to acute myelogenous leukemia (FPD/AML). Sporadic point mutations are frequently found in three leukemia entities: AML M0 subtype, MDS-AML, and secondary (therapy-related) MDS/AML. Therapy-related leukemias resulting from anticancer treatments are not uncommon, and the incidence of RUNX1 point mutations appears comparable to the incidence of the t(8;21) AML M2 subtype and the inv(16) AML M4Eo subtype. Half of the point mutations in M0 cases are biallelic, although the frequency varies with ethnicity. Most of the RUNX1 mutations are clustered in the Runt domain and result in defective DNA binding but active beta-subunit binding, which is consistent with three-dimensional structural findings and may explain the dominant inhibitory effects. Unlike the classical tumor suppressor genes requiring biallelic inactivation, haploinsufficient RUNX1 is apparently leukemogenic. However, RUNX1 abnormalities per se are insufficient to cause full-blown leukemia. Intensive investigation of cooperating genetic alterations should elucidate leukemic mechanisms.  Keywords: RUNX, AML1, PEBP2, point mutation, familial leukemia Top of page Introduction Since the discovery of the Philadelphia chromosome, t(9;22), in chronic myelogenous leukemia in 1960, leukemia researchers and physicians have paid much attention to the investigation of chromosomal translocations and resultant chimeric genes. It was also the case for RUNX1/AML1-related leukemia (also known as CBF leukemia, hereafter referred to as RUNX leukemia). Miyoshi et al. (1991) identified AML1 as a gene located on the breakpoint of chromosomal translocation t(8;21) in 1991. Since then, leukemia research on AML1/RUNX1 has been exclusively concentrated on investigating t(8;21) and resultant AML1(RUNX1)/ETO(MTG8); t(3;21), RUNX1/EVI1; t(12;21), TEL(ETV6)-RUNX1; and inv(16), PEBP2beta(CBFbeta)/MYH11. In 1999, Osato et al. (1999) and Song et al. (1999)reported a RUNX1 point mutation in sporadic and familial myeloid leukemia, respectively. Subsequent studies have identified point mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), predominantly in the M0 subtype, in different ethnic groups (Preudhomme et al., 2000; Langabeer et al., 2002; Matsuno et al., 2003; Roumier et al., 2003a, 2003b; Silva et al., 2003). Until recently, mutations were believed to cluster within the Runt domain. However, mutations in the C-terminal region, outside the Runt domain, have also been identified, predominantly in MDS-AML (Harada et al., 2004). Finally, RUNX1 point mutations turned out to occur with comparable frequency to the first mode of RUNX1 alterations, namely, t(8;21), inv(16), and t(12;21), in secondary MDS/AML (Harada et al., 2003). Accordingly, the RUNX1 point mutation is fully recognized as the second mode of leukemogenesis in RUNX leukemia. In this review, I summarize the currently available cases of point mutations and discuss the leukemogenesis mediated by RUNX1+/- status.  Top of page Frequency and distribution of the point mutations The RUNX1 gene consists of 10 exons (exons 1â€“6, 7A, 7B, 7C, and 8) and two promoters followed by the distinct initiation codon in exon 1 and exon 3. The proximal promoter-driven transcript starts in exon 3 and encodes 453 amino acids (aa) (full length 453), whereas the distal promoter-driven transcript from exon 1 encodes 480 aa (full length 480). Full length 480 contains an additional 32 aa instead of 5 aa from the full length 453 in its N-terminal end. Thus, both full lengths share exons 3â€“6, 7B, and 8 and nearly the complete coding sequence. The Runt domain, a highly conserved 128 aa protein motif responsible for both DNA binding and heterodimerization with the beta-subunit PEBP2beta/CBFbeta spans aa 50â€“178 in full length 453 and is located on exons 3â€“5. All RUNX1 mutation-screening studies covered exons 3â€“5, and most included intron sequences flanking the exon. A few studies screened exons 1 and 2 as well, and half of the studies did not cover exons 6â€“8 encoding the C-terminal moiety where the transactivation domain spanning aa 291â€“371 is located. All types of human leukemia, except chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), have been extensively investigated. In addition, a significant number of cell lines, including those established from solid tumors, as well as healthy volunteers were also included in the mutation screenings (Table 1) (Langabeer et al., 2002; Vegesna et al., 2002; Harada et al., 2003; Taketani et al., 2003). A total of 102 cases out of the 1786 tested had a RUNX1 alteration including a point mutation and gene deletion. Most of the nucleotide changes resulted in amino-acid changes with clear functional defects as shown in Figure 1. However, some mutations failed to show any apparent functional alterations, and the nucleotide change may have been constitutive or leukemia specific. Nucleotide changes that do not lead to amino-acid change (synonymous) may generate an abnormal splicing donor or acceptor site, resulting in a nonfunctional protein. These enigmatic cases are listed as &#x27;variation&#x27; in Table 1. The numbers of mutations in Table 1 include variation cases. Most of the mutations are clustered within the Runt domain (Figure 1); N-terminal region, 9 (8.6%); Runt domain, 84 (80.8%); C-terminal region, 11 (10.5%). The total number of mutations (Table 1 and Figure 1) differs (104 vs 102) because the compiled mutants in Figure 1 include 11 cases from FPD/AML, which are not listed in Table 1. Conversely, gene deletion is not included in Figure 1, while a biallelic case in Table 1 provides two distinct mutations simultaneously.  Figure 1.

If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author Full table  Top of page Functional consequence, haploinsufficiency Entire gene deletions and early truncated-type mutations (frameshift or nonsense mutations) were found with significant frequency. Most of the missense mutations also lost their DNA binding and transcriptional activities (Figure 1, right-middle column). Since the majority of cases are heterozygous, haploinsufficiency appears to be a basis for pathogenesis. This notion is most strongly supported by the whole gene deletion in FPD/AML. RUNX1+/- status is likely to provide the cells with a growth advantage to overcome &#x27;selective pressure&#x27; in the subject. However, if this were the only mechanism, mutations would be distributed throughout the gene without &#x27;hot spots&#x27;. Therefore, clustering in the Runt domain suggests that a mechanism other than genuine haploinsufficiency is important for leukemogenesis.  Top of page Dominant negative effect by the retained bold italic beta-binding activity In the Runt domain, eight regions or &#x27;hot spots&#x27; were affected more than twice (Figure 1). Two different mechanisms are probably at least partly responsible. First, the primary sequence of particular sites seems to be preferably targeted by the mutation mechanism. R139, R174, and R177 are encoded by triplets containing CpG dinucleotides, which are extremely prone to transition-type mutations by a mechanism facilitated by methylation of the cytidine residue (Rodenhiser et al., 1997; Yoshida et al., 2003). Second, certain mutation sites are considered to provide cells a stronger growth advantage under &#x27;selective pressure&#x27;. Mapping of the missense mutations strongly supports this notion. Three regions recurrently affected by missense mutations exclusively correspond to three loop-containing regions responsible for DNA binding: betaP1â€“loop(betaP1â€“betaB), betaE&#x27;â€“loop(betaE&#x27;â€“betaF), and betaP2â€“loop(betaP2â€“C-terminus) (Figure 2) (Nagata et al., 1999; Osato et al., 2001; Tahirov et al., 2001). Consequently, these mutants are defective only in DNA binding, and not in packing or heterodimerization (Figure 1), which may explain the dominant negative effects of the RUNX1 mutants. In cotransfection assays, missense and some nonsense mutants showed inhibitory effects towards transactivation mediated by wild-type RUNX1. These mutants bound to PEBP2beta/CBFbeta more efficiently than wild-type RUNX1 (Imai et al., 2000; Michaud et al., 2002). In addition, PEBP2beta protects RUNX1 from ubiquitinâ€“proteasome-mediated degradation (Huang et al., 2001). Thus, preferential binding of mutant RUNX1 proteins to PEBP2beta may in turn increase protein half-life and hence further augment the dominant negative effects. In the right-end column of Figure 1, a general correlation can be seen between the retained beta-binding activity and the inhibitory potential of each mutant. This correlation is more clearly indicated by the comparison of the distribution of missense mutations between RUNX1 and RUNX2 (Figure 2). Germline mutation of RUNX2 causes the bone disease cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) (Mundlos et al., 1997). The missense mutations of RUNX2 distributed throughout the Runt domain affected the overall folding architecture in the cases marked by asterisks in Figure 2, resulting in impairment of both DNA- binding and heterodimerization activity (packing defect). The mutations underlined in Figure 2 showed defects in beta binding alone. In clear contrast, no such mutations resulting in defective packing or beta binding have been found in RUNX1 so far. (Some reported cases are mapped to the residues responsible for packing (suspected cases), but functional analyses have not yet been performed. No suspected case with defect in beta binding alone has been reported.) Conversely, mutations mapping to the first DNA interacting region, betaP1-loop (betaP1-betaB), are seen in RUNX1 but not in RUNX2 (Figure 2) (Yoshida et al., 2003). These RUNX1 mutants, R80C, K83N, and K83E showed strong affinity for the beta-subunit and hence a strong dominant negative effect, suggesting that haploinsufficiency is a dominant mechanism in RUNX2 mutants, whereas a dominant negative effect is important in RUNX1 mutants. Sequestration of the beta-subunit may be one important mechanism of the dominant negative effect caused by the RUNX1 mutants.  Figure 2.

If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author Structural mappings of the missense mutations detected in leukemia or the bone disease CCD. The RUNX1 mutants in leukemia (rectangular outline, orange) are mapped exclusively to the three regions involved in DNA binding, whereas the RUNX2 mutations in CCD (blue) are distributed all over the Runt domain except for the loop (betaP1-betaF). Mutations associated with packing (asterisk) and beta-binding (underline) defects are found only in CCD. Adapted from Nagata et al. (1999)  Full figure and legend (307K)  Top of page The lower the RUNX1 activity, the higher the leukemogenicity How does the dominant negative effect mentioned above relate to leukemogenesis? Although the limited number of individuals and minimal clinical information evaluated prohibit a robust conclusion, families with mutations acting simply via haploinsufficiency have a lower incidence of leukemia than families with mutations acting in a dominant-negative fashion. In two of the largest FPD/AML pedigrees, leukemia occurred at a markedly higher rate in the family with the strong dominant negative K83E mutation (57%) compared to the pedigree with a complete deletion of RUNX1 (24%) (Table 2) (Song et al., 1999; Michaud et al., 2002). Thus, low RUNX1 activity appears to correlate with high leukemogenicity. The hypothesis may be expanded to some extent to leukemogenesis induced by chimeric genes. The majority of current findings indicate that a major function of chimeric genes is a transdominant inhibition of wild-type RUNX1, resulting in severely decreased RUNX1 activity in affected cells. Currently, more than 10 partner genes fused with RUNX1 have been identified in chromosomal translocations. Although each chimeric gene may have its own leukemogenic mechanism, RUNX1 insufficiency may be a common underlying mechanism in RUNX leukemias.

If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author Full table  Acquired trisomy 21 underscores this notion. RUNX1+/- mutant alleles appear to be duplicated frequently. This finding may also lend supporting evidence to the hypothesis that reduced RUNX1 activity increases leukemogenic status. This argument will be discussed later.  Top of page Mutation status â€“ disease phenotype in sporadic leukemias Biallelic mutation and AML M0 subtype RUNX1 point mutations were most frequently found in the AML M0 subtype (Table 1). In addition, 22 of the 39 (56.4%) M0 cases showed the biallelic type of mutation (Table 3). Conversely, only two of the 80 RUNX1 mutation cases in other leukemia subtypes were the biallelic type. Therefore, it is clear that RUNX1 point mutations of the biallelic type are tightly associated with the AML M0 subtype. Mice heterozygous for the RUNX1-MTG8 or PEBP2beta(CBFbeta)-MYH11 chimeric genes showed defects in definitive hematopoiesis similar to Runx1-/- mice, suggesting that the chimeric genes can act as strong transdominant inhibitors of the remaining normal Runx1 allele (Castilla et al., 1996; Okuda et al., 1996; Yergeau et al., 1997). Therefore, the leukemogenic potential of biallelic RUNX1 mutants is considered equivalent to those of chimeric genes. On the other hand, t(8;21), inv(16), and biallelic point mutations are related to the distinct M2, M4Eo, and M0 subtypes of myeloid leukemias, respectively. The different disease phenotypes are quite interesting. The contribution of each partner gene, thought to be considerable, may also be explained by the different residual activities of RUNX1 in the affected adult hematopoietic cells. Conditional Runx1 knockout mice showed apparent defects in hematopoiesis (Ichikawa et al., 2004), whereas hematopoiesis in conditional heterozygous RUNX1-ETO knockin mice was nearly normal (Higuchi et al., 2002), suggesting that Runx1-/- induces more severe effects than the RUNX1-ETO chimeric gene in adult hematopoiesis. The M0 subtype shows minimally differentiated morphology, while the M2 subtype is characteristically well differentiated. Therefore, the differing residual activities of RUNX1 seem to be important. In addition, influence on the activities of other RUNX family genes must be considered because RUNX1-MTG8 or PEBP2beta (CBFbeta)-MYH11 chimeric genes could inhibit RUNX2 and RUNX3 as well, while RUNX1-/- status is a defect in RUNX1 alone. Careful study will resolve this intriguing issue. Table 3 - RUNX1 mutations in AML M0 subtype. Table 3 - RUNX1 mutations in AML M0 subtype - Unfortunately we are unable to provide accessible alternative text for this. If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author Full table  Of note, the biallelic-type mutation is strictly confined to the status with two copies of RUNX1. Biallelic mutation in trisomy 21 is not associated with the AML M0 subtype, but is associated with myeloid malignancies other than M0. This phenotypic difference will be discussed later.  Entire distribution including the C-terminal moiety and MDS-AML/secondary leukemia The RUNX1 point mutations are also frequently found in MDS and subsequent overt leukemia (referred to in this review as MDS-AML) (Tables 1 and 4). The mutations are characteristically distributed, as they were also detected in the C-terminal region which is rarely targeted in other types of leukemias (Harada et al., 2004). Since this distribution was only recently identified, C-terminal mutations were overlooked in a number of previous studies. Half of the studies did not investigate exons 7B and 8 in the C-terminal region. With regard to MDS-AML, the incidence covering both exons 3â€“6 and exons 3â€“8 were evaluated less frequently than those of exons 3â€“8 alone (Table 4). Thus, C-terminal mutations may be underestimated in MDS-AML. However, C-terminal mutations still seem rare in AML, since C-terminal mutations were not identified in the study with a relatively large number of cases. Therefore, RUNX1 point mutations including the C-terminal moiety appear to be found predominantly in MDS-AML. Table 4 - RUNX1 mutations in MDS.

If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author Full table  Harada et al. (2003) from Hiroshima, one of the two cities suffered from atomic bomb, reported two further implications of RUNX1 mutations in secondary MDS or AML (referred to in this review as MDS/AML), including therapy-related and atomic bomb-related MDS/AML. Firstly, the relationship to radiation seems important in terms of the social issue. In addition to the victims in the above two cities, an estimated 220 000 US soldiers and a significant number of local residents and passengers have been irradiated in the aboveground nuclear weapon test sites at Nevada, Bikini atoll, and others in the late 1940s to 1950s. Many of these people are thought to have succumbed to MDS/AML caused by RUNX1 point mutation. Secondly, the involvement in therapy-related MDS/AML seems to have more general impact. With the improvement of treatments for primary cancer, the incidence of therapy-related MDS/AML continues to increase. Therapy-related MDS/AML accounts for roughly 10â€“20% of all new cases of MDS and AML in standard hospitals. Therefore, the incidence of secondary MDS/AML with RUNX1 mutation is comparable to those of t(8;21) AML M2 subtype and inv(16) AML M4Eo subtype (Table 5). Considering its poor prognosis, clinical implication of RUNX1 point mutation in secondary MDS/AML would be rather more significant than we expected.  Table 5 - Estimated frequency of leukemia with RUNX1 point mutation. Table 5 - Estimated frequency of leukemia with RUNX1 point mutation - Unfortunately we are unable to provide accessible alternative text for this. If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author Full table  Leukemic incidence rates were based on several textbooks and public databases from CDC, WHO, and National Cancer Institute (NIH). CLL accounts for 10â€“30%, which may explain the relatively low incidences of t(8;21), inv(16), and t(12;21).  Acquired (not congenital) trisomy 21 and non-MO myeloid malignancy Preudhomme et al. (2000) first reported the relationship between trisomy 21 and RUNX1 point mutation (Table 6). Sporadic cases of myeloid but not lymphoid malignancy with trisomy 21 were associated with a high frequency of RUNX1 point mutations. Taketani et al. (2002) subsequently surveyed RUNX1 mutation in congenital cases of trisomy 21, that is, the Down syndrome-related hematopoietic diseases. However, point mutation in congenital cases appears to be rare except for the enigmatic H58N variation, which has nearly normal function. Allelic analysis of sporadic cases with acquired trisomy 21 showed the following combination: 2â€“3 mutant vs 0â€“1 wild type. The co-occurrence of mutation and trisomy 21 should be associated with the allelic combination with one mutant and two WT combination. However, this combination has never been found. These findings suggest that trisomy 21 increases the copy number of the mutant allele, which already exists in the status of two copies of RUNX1. In other words, trisomy 21 is thought to be a secondary change to RUNX1+/- status. Trisomy 21 as a second hit will be discussed later. Table 6 - Trisomy 21 and RUNX1 mutation. Table 6 - Trisomy 21 and RUNX1 mutation - Unfortunately we are unable to provide accessible alternative text for this. If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author Full table  As mentioned earlier, biallelic RUNX1 mutations are tightly liked to the AML M0 subtype. However, interestingly, acquired +21 carrying a RUNX1 point mutation has never been observed in the AML M0 subtype, even in cases with biallelic mutations (Table 6). This &#x27;discrepancy&#x27; is not explained by the differing residual activities of RUNX1, as half of the M0 cases with RUNX1 mutation are monoallelic. Leukemic phenotype may be determined by an as yet undetermined mechanism.  Top of page Familial leukemia, FPD/AML Heterozygous germline mutation in the RUNX1 gene causes familial leukemia, familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myelogenous leukemia (FPD/AML). A total of 12 pedigrees have been identified so far, mainly in individuals of European descent (Table 2). FPD alone, before the onset of AML, is not fatal but significantly inhibits blood clotting, which could be life threatening after surgery, injury, dental treatment, or childbirth. The incidence of leukemia among affected individuals varies from 20 to 50% (average 35%), and is highest in familial leukemia syndromes including Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome, and Kostman syndrome. The affected subjects seem to develop myeloid malignancies throughout their life span, but not later in life as described in some previous reports. Leukemia developed before the age of 10 years in four of 11 cases. These features of FPD/AML were compared with a similar dominant hereditary disease, Huntington disease (HD). The subjects of HD are healthy until disease onset at 30â€“50 years of age and die 10â€“15 years later. In addition to the low penetrance and/or low severity of symptoms, late onset is a key factor for hereditary disease, since patients often have children before disease symptoms appear. On the other hands, FPD/AML seems detrimental to the subjects in any factors of hereditary disease. How can such a pedigree full of drawbacks exist? FPD/AML may persist as a disease due to the easy-mutability of RUNX1. As discussed before, RUNX1 indeed contains easy-mutable primary sequences: triplets containing CpG dinucleotides extremely prone to transition-type mutations facilitated by methylation of the cytidine residue (Rodenhiser et al., 1997; Yoshida et al., 2003). This mechanism could work particularly well in germ cells. The FPD/AML pedigree may readily disappear in the human population, while a &#x27;de novo&#x27; pedigree could be continually generated with comparable frequency. Consistent with this argument, of CCD cases caused by RUNX2 mutation, approximately half are the &#x27;de novo&#x27; and not the familial type (Zhou et al., 1999). Irradiation readily generates CCD-like phenotypes in mice due to Runx2 alterations. RUNX2 shares the above noted easy-mutable sequences. In the case of RUNX1, healthy British subjects have two kinds of variations: L29S and S21syn with 5 and 3% frequency, respectively (Langabeer et al., 2002). Japanese subjects also have several recurrent enigmatic variations: G42R, I87syn, and H58N. Interestingly, G42R was identified in both leukemia patients and healthy volunteers (Harada et al., 2003; Taketani et al., 2003). These variations, probably including polymorphisms, might reflect the above noted easy-mutability of RUNX1.  As mentioned above, FPD/AML is extremely rare worldwide. Therefore, this clinical entity had been overlooked by physicians until recently. Bone marrow transplantaion was carried out from an affected sibling with mild FPD symptoms to a patient suffering from AML (Buijs et al., 2001). The recipient succumbed to leukemia again, clearly from the hematopoietic cells derived from the donor.  Top of page Genetic alterations cooperating with RUNX1+/- status As mentioned earlier, RUNX1-/- status is frequently found in the AML M0 subtype. Thus, RUNX1 may appear to act as a classical tumor suppressor gene, requiring inactivation of two alleles according to Knudson&#x27;s two hits theory. However, biallelic inactivation is not required in all cases of leukemogenesis; in fact, the overall frequency of biallelic cases is relatively low (27 of 102 cases, or 26%). Biallelic cases of FPD/AML have never been reported. Therefore, RUNX1+/- per se appears to be leukemogenic. The dominant negative effect associated with missense mutations might play a role in leukemogenesis, but not to the same extent as gene inactivation. In any case, heterozygous mutation appears to be a step towards leukemogenesis. Therefore, a mutation in the wild-type RUNX1 on the remaining allele is considered to be a second hit in addition to RUNX1+/- status. Furthermore, acquired but not congenital trisomy 21 is also thought to be a second hit. As discussed earlier, the link between +21 and RUNX1 mutation is interpreted as follows; a mutation takes place in the two copy status and the mutant allele is duplicated in accordance with +21. In both RUNX1-/- and +21 cases, acquirement of another mutant allele is therefore thought to be an additional genetic alteration cooperating with RUNX1+/- status (Figure 3).  Figure 3. Figure 3 - Unfortunately we are unable to provide accessible alternative text for this. If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author Leukemogenesis from Runx1+/-. Biallelic mutations of RUNX1 (RUNX1-/-) are tightly liked to the AML M0 subtype. However, acquired +21 carrying a RUNX1 point mutation (RUNX1+/-/-) has never been observed in M0, despite cases with biallelic mutations. Mutation likely takes place in the two copy status (RUNX1+/-) and the mutant allele is duplicated in accordance with +21, resulting in myeloid malignancies other than M0. FLT-3 mutations were frequently found in M0 cases with RUNX1 point mutations. These genetic alterations are mapped based on such observations  Full figure and legend (55K)  In line with +21, cytogenetics helps to identify second hits. Patients with RUNX1 point mutations show the following concurrent abnormalities; 12 cases showed -7; 6, +8; 5,+13 (Tables 2, 3 and 4). Loss of chromosome 7 is suspected to be a strong predisposing factor for the second hit in RUNX1+/-.  FLT-3 mutations were frequently observed even in monoallelic RUNX1 mutations in M0 patients (Table 3) (Matsuno et al., 2003; Roumier et al., 2003a, 2003b). Hence, the FLT-3 mutation is also a cooperating genetic alteration (Figure 3). FLT-3 mutation results in a constitutively active form known to stimulate cell proliferation. Therefore, differentiation blockade by RUNX1 alteration and growth stimulation by FLT3 mutation would synergistically contribute to a substantial fraction of AML M0 subtype cases. Interesting enough, FLT-3 mutations are known to be rare in the other RUNX leukemias, t(8;21) and inv(16). Certain RUNX leukemias seem to cooperate with distinct second hits. Elucidation of this mechanism might shed light on development of RUNX leukemias.  Top of page Current problems Region for mutation screening As discussed previously, half of the screening studies did not cover C-terminal exons 7B and 8 and therefore overlooked C-terminal mutations in MDS-AML. C-terminal screening is unlikely to reveal information about AML but is recommended. Likewise, exons 1 and 2 might be affected in particular types of leukemia. Theoretically, the promoter and untranslated regions could also be targeted. Variations Significant numbers of variations are reported, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 1. Functional analyses have not yet been performed in all the cases. Each variation must be studied to determine if it is a mutation or a polymorphism. Analyses of polymorphisms might help to characterize susceptibility to leukemia. Dominant negative effect by C-terminal mutants in MDS-AML In the reporter assay, all C-terminal mutants found in MDS-AML showed inhibitory effects in a transdominant manner, like the missense mutants in the Runt domain (Harada et al., 2004). However, similar C-terminal RUNX2 mutations in CCD patients retain partial transactivation activity and show much milder phenotypes compared to the standard CCD phenotypes, which are caused by simple gene deletions (Yoshida et al., 2002). This discrepancy may be due to the distinct cell context or promoter used for the assay. However, a correlation with MDS but not AML might indicate that C-terminal mutants have milder inhibitory effects than Runt domain mutants. The biological assay, but not the reporter assay, may address this issue. Cooperative genetic alterations FLT-3 mutation and +21 are thought to be second hits in MDS/AML with RUNX1 mutations. High frequency of chromosome 7 loss suggests inactivation of the unknown gene on chromosome 7 plays a synergistic role with RUNX1 mutations. However, the overall frequency of these mutations does not account for all cases. Furthermore, to induce a leukemia, three to five genetic alterations are considered to be required based on current evidence. Therefore, a number of genetic alterations must be identified to understand the whole leukemogenic mechanism of RUNX leukemia. My laboratory recently established a mouse system that appears to be quite useful. Myeloid leukemia-prone mice mimicking FPD/AML were generated by backcrossing Runx1+/- onto the BXH2 strain, in which retroviral insertional mutagenesis occurs spontaneously with the eventual development of myeloid leukemia in over 90% of the cases (Li et al., 1999). The proviral integration sites in the leukemias provide powerful genetic tags for disease gene identification. Therefore, collaborating oncogenes with Runx1+/- would be readily detected. Loss-of-function of RUNX1 is widely believed to be the common underlying mechanism of RUNX leukemia. RUNX1+/- status is considered to be the minimum alteration required for several forms of RUNX leukemias. Therefore, the mouse model for FPD/AML mentioned above should be useful for searching for cooperative genetic alterations in the other RUNX leukemias, t(8;21) and inv(16). These genetic alterations identified by the retroviral tagging system might explain the leukemogenic mechanisms not only of RUNX1 point mutations but also of other RUNX leukemias. Top of page Future directions Why is RUNX1+/- status leukemogenic? This question seems to be the most fundamental question not only for RUNX1 point mutation but also all RUNX leukemias. Determining the means by which RUNX1+/- is leukemogenic may not be possible by the currently used approaches to evaluate differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis at the cellular level and transcriptional control at the molecular level. A novel approach is warranted. For example, alteration of &#x27;stemness&#x27; should be investigated in RUNX1+/- status. Stemness could provide cells with a time window sufficient for sequential genetic alterations. Intrinsic molecular functions relevant to leukemogenesis, other than transcriptional control, might be identified by novel approaches.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;The most frequent mutations associated with leukemia are recurrent somatic chromosomal translocations or inversions, many of which involve the polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein or core-binding factor transcriptional regulation complex (PEBP2/CBF). Several translocations involve the Î± subunit of this complex, the RUNX1 gene (also called AML1, CBFÎ±2, or PEBP2Î±B) on chromosome 21q22.1 (t(8;21), t(3;21), and t(12;21)). Additionally, the Î² subunit of the complex, PEBP2Î² also called CBFÎ², is disrupted in inv(16)(p13;q22).1 An abundance of evidence points to the existence of genes that predispose to hematologic malignancies. However, large multiple-generation families with hematologic malignancies alone are rare.2 Only 2 loci for familial hematologic malignancies have been identified to date, 1 on chromosome 21q22.13 and the other on 16q22.4 5 These loci contain RUNX1 andPEBP2Î²/CBFÎ², respectively.Studies of families that demonstrate single-gene inheritance for leukemia predisposition should help to identify the genes and mechanisms involved in the first steps of leukemia development. The autosomal dominant familial platelet disorder (FPD)/AML (acute myelogenous leukemia; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man no. 601399) is a good model to validate this hypothesis because, in addition to developing thrombocytopenia, patients show a propensity for progression to myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia.6-9 Affected individuals within the same family may present with variable clinical severity at varying ages. FPD/AML was linked to 21q22.1-22.2,3 9 including the region that contains RUNX1, and germline RUNX1 mutations were subsequently identified in 6 pedigrees.10Heterozygous missense mutations and biallelic nonsense or frameshift mutations in RUNX1 were also identified in sporadic leukemias,11 and other point mutations have been characterized in patients with M0-AML and various myeloid malignancies,12 including some with acquired trisomy and tetrasomy of chromosome 21.13 While missense mutations abolish the DNA binding and transactivation activities of RUNX1, they do not affect heterodimerization with PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ². In addition, these mutant proteins inhibit wild-type RUNX1 in cotransfection studies.11 12The evolutionarily conserved 128 amino acid Runt domain, present in most of RUNX1 isoforms, is involved in DNA binding and heterodimerization with PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ².14 15Heterodimerization of RUNX1 with PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² promotes DNA binding by stabilizing the interaction of the complex with the DNA.16 17 All RUNX1 point mutations described in FPD/AML patients10 and most RUNX1 point mutations in patients with sporadic leukemias11-13 are within the Runt domain and alter amino acids essential for DNA binding and heterodimerization.18 19 Longer RUNX1 proteins also contain a transactivation domain and domains involved in self-regulation, protein-protein interaction, and cellular localization.20 RUNX1 regulates the activity of several important hematopoietic genes, such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor,21 T-cell receptor Î± and Î²,22 granulocyte-macrophage (GM)â€“CSF,23myeloperoxidase,24 and neutrophil elastase,25by binding to a core sequence (TGT/cGGT) found in their promoters or enhancers.It has been proposed that haploinsufficiency for RUNX1 is responsible for FPD/AML.10 However, hyperactivating, inhibitory, and loss-of-function RUNX1 point mutations have all been reported in sporadic leukemia.11 This diversity in the mechanisms of pathogenesis of sporadic AML RUNX1 mutations suggested that FPD/AML RUNX1 mutations warranted further functional studies. Here we describe 3 new RUNX1 mutations in FPD/AML and potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the disease based on in vitro studies of 7 RUNX1 FPD/AML mutations.Materials and methodsSample collection and genomic DNA isolationOur FPD/AML pedigrees are shown in Figure1. Pedigree 1 has been extensively described.7 Fourteen members of the family have a hemorrhagic diathesis characterized by a long bleeding time, abnormal platelet aggregation, and decreased numbers of platelet-dense bodies. Among the affected individuals, there were 3 documented cases of myeloblastic leukemia, 2 documented cases of myelomonoblastic leukemia, and 3 cases of leukemia by history.Fig. 1.Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFig. 1. The FPD/AML pedigrees unique to this study.All 3 pedigrees show linkage to FPD/AML locus (21q22.1-22.2). Half-filled symbols represent individuals who had a bleeding disorder and, where studied, a platelet defect as well, and completely filled symbols represent affected individuals who developed leukemia.Pedigree 2 (previously unreported) has 8 affected individuals from 4 generations with a clinical history of prolonged bleeding. Constitutional thrombocytopenia was found in 5 members, 3 of whom had extensive platelet evaluations documenting aspirinlike aggregation defects and dense granule abnormality demonstrable by electron microscopic morphology and quinacrine fluorescence. Three individuals developed AML, and a fourth was said to have died of â€œpernicious anemia.â€�Pedigree 3 consists of 15 affected individuals from 4 generations of a family with a bleeding disorder characterized by impaired platelet aggregation associated with decreased numbers and contents of both platelet-dense and Î± granules26 27 as well as a unique platelet phospholipid defect and decreased Î±-2 adrenergic receptors.28 29 The platelet counts in this family are at or slightly below the lower limit of normal.26 27 Two members of the family developed AML, and another was reported to have died of leukemia.29Blood samples were obtained from healthy and affected individuals after obtaining informed consent and in accordance with institutional guidelines for human subjects. DNA was isolated from blood leukocytes using standard protocols.Linkage analysisGenotype information was generated with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of chromosome 21 microsatellite markers from the Genome Database (http://www.gdb.org). Linkage analysis was as previously described.4 5 At least 7 microsatellite repeat polymorphisms in the FPD/AML critical region of chromosome 21q22.1â€‰3 were genotyped in each family.Mutation analysesAll 9 exons of RUNX1 were amplified from genomic DNA using primers designed to the flanking region of each exon. Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis was performed on PCR fragments of less than 400 base pairs using a Genephor apparatus and the GeneGel 12.5 kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). Exons showing conformational changes were directly sequenced in both directions using BigDye terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and analyzed on an ABI377 sequencer.RT-PCRFirst-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from patient (individuals IV:2 and V:2, pedigree 2) and control RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase. PCR was performed using primers AML1RTF3 (Figure 2D, primer C, 5â€²-CTGCTCCGTGCTGCCTACGCACTG-3â€²) in exon 3 of AML1b and AMLRTR1 (5â€²-CGCAGCTGCTCCAGTTCACTGAGC-3â€²) in exon 6 as reverse primer on these double-stranded cDNAs, cloned into a TA vector, and sequenced. A cryptic splice site was observed in one clone. Primers covering the cryptic splice junction of exon 4 and 5 (F2AMLmF4, Figure 2D, primer A, 5â€²-TAATGACCTCAGGGAAAAGCTTC-3â€²) and within the nucleotides of exon 4 excluded from the mutant transcript (F2AMLF1, Figure 2D, primer B, 5â€²-TGTCGGTCGAAGTGGAAGAGG-3â€²) were designed and used with AML1RTR1 to amplify a PCR product on patients&#x27; cDNA; no mutant transcript was observed in control cDNA.Fig. 2.Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFig. 2.

(F) Sequence analysis of the mutant exon 4â€“exon 5 junction.Electrophoretic mobility shift assayAmino acids 24 to 189 of RUNX1, including the Runt domain, were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) essentially as described previously.11 The wild-type expression plasmid was previously described,11 and mutant RUNX1 plasmids were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis on wild-type pQE9-RUNX1 using Strategene&#x27;s â€œquick changeâ€� method according to the manufacturer&#x27;s instruction manual (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). For K90fsX101 an alternative vector, pQE13, was used instead to express it in fusion with a more bulky N-terminal appendage containing hexahistidines and dihydrofolate reductase. Mutant constructs were confirmed by sequencing.Affinity assay of RUNX1-PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² associationThe heterodimerization activity of RUNX1 mutants impaired in DNA binding was assayed by MagExtractor kit (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). Briefly, the hexahistidine-tagged RUNX1 fragment (1 Î¼g) was incubated with tagless PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² (1 Î¼g) and mixed with nickel-coated magnetic beads. The mixture was successively washed with buffers containing 30 mM imidazole and eluted by the buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Proteins in each fraction were analyzed as previously described.11Subcellular localizationFor functional studies of mutated RUNX1 proteins, the wild-type RUNX1 sequence (1-453) was inserted into the pEF-BOS mammalian expression plasmid. Construction of RUNX1 mutants was carried out using the megaprimers method,30 and the resultant plasmids were transfected into NIH3T3 or REF52 (H58N, K83N, R177Q, and R177X only) cells using a nonliposomal transfection reagent FuGENE6 (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). Immunofluorescence labeling of RUNX1 and PEBP2Î²CBFÎ² and microscopy were as previously described.11 For each transfection 50 cells were visualized.Transactivation assaysThe luciferase reporter plasmid (pM-CSF-R-luc) and the effector plasmid (pEF-AML1), containing the 453 amino acid isoform of RUNX1 with the mutations to be studied, were transfected at a fixed ratio (0.5 and 0.8 Î¼g per assay, respectively) into U937, HL60, and Jurkat cells. Cell extracts were prepared 48 hours after transfection and assayed essentially as described.11 To study the inhibitory effect of mutant RUNX1 proteins on wild-type RUNX1 reporter gene activation, 0.5 Î¼g pM-CSF-R-luc and 0.1 to 0.8 Î¼g pEF constructs expressing either RUNX1 with or without mutations or PEBP2Î²-MYH11 were cotransfected into U937, HL60, and Jurkat cells. The total amount of DNA transfected was kept constant (1.3 Î¼g) by supplementing appropriate amounts of the backbone pEF plasmid, thereby avoiding potential artifacts due to unbalanced DNA dosages.Partial rescue from repression was obtained by transfecting varying doses of PEBP2Î²CBFÎ² with a repressive dose of wild-type and mutant proteins.ResultsLinkage and mutation analyses of the 3 new pedigreesEach of the 3 families demonstrated features typical of FPD/AML. A candidate region genetic linkage analysis provided maximum 2-point log odds ratio scores of 3.14, 2.15, and 2.43 (Î¸â€‰=â€‰0) with markers D21S1413 in pedigree 1, IFNAR in pedigree 2, and D21S65 in pedigree 3. Extended haplotype analysis of each family indicated an approximate 3 megabase common nonrecombinant interval on human chromosome 21q22.1 containing RUNX1 in affected individuals.Pedigree 1 showed an A&amp;gt;G substitution in exon 3 resulting in a missense mutation, K83E (Figure 2A). The mutation segregates with the disorder in the family and was absent in 188 unrelated control chromosomes. Pedigree 2 showed a one-base deletion in the splice donor site of intron 4, IVS4â€‰+â€‰3delA (Figure 2C). The mutation segregates with the disorder in the family and was absent in 184 unrelated control chromosomes. Reverse transcriptase (RT)â€“PCR on RNA from affected individuals showed the use of a cryptic donor splice site, not used in control RNA, 23 nucleotides upstream of the normal splice site (Figure 2D-F). The novel transcript generated by the use of the cryptic splice site results in a frameshift after amino acid 135, addition of 41 unrelated residues, and termination at codon 177 (R135fsX177). Pedigree 3 showed a C&amp;gt;A substitution in exon 7B resulting in a nonsense mutation, Y260X (Figure 2B). The mutation segregated with the disease in all family members tested.Effects of RUNX1 FPD/AML mutations on DNA binding and heterodimerization activities of the Runt domainWe examined the function of the Runt domain for 2 new (K83E and R135fsX177; SWISS-PROT Q01196) and 5 described (R139Q, R174Q, K90fsX101, R174X, R177X)10 FPD/AML point mutations. On EMSA analyses, R139Q, R174X, and R177X alone showed barely detectable DNA binding but produced a supershift band of increased intensity in the presence of PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ², indicating that heterodimerization of these mutants with PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² still occurs (Figure3A). K83E, R135fsX177, R174Q, and K90fsX101 showed no detectable DNA binding in the presence or absence of PEBPÎ²/CBFÎ². An affinity assay of these mutants for heterodimerization with PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² revealed that both missense mutants retained the ability to heterodimerize whereas both frameshift mutants did not (Figure 3B).Fig. 3.Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFig. 3.

The bands marked with arrows indicate the Î² subunits associated with RUNX1 proteins.Subcellular localization of the FPD/AML RUNX1 mutants and colocalization with PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ²In RUNX1 a nuclear localization signal (NLS) is present at amino acids 167 to 183 at the end of the Runt domain. RUNX1 wild-type protein is localized in the nucleus with a diffuse pattern and is excluded from the nucleoli (Figure 4A). Transfection of mutant full-length cDNAs into NIH3T3 cells and immunostaining the expressed RUNX1 proteins revealed that the frameshift (R135fsX177 and K90fsX101, no NLS) and nonsense (R174X and R177X, half of the NLS is missing) mutants are localized almost exclusively in the cytoplasm. Consistent with the importance of basic amino acids in the NLS, R174Q and R177Q (a sporadic mutation described by Osato et al11) showed cytoplasmic localization in 20% and 5% of observed cells, respectively (Figure 4A).Fig. 4.Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFig. 4. Subcellular localization of mutant RUNX1 proteins and colocalization with PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ².(A) Subcellular localization of the indicated RUNX1 proteins was detected by immunofluorescence staining with anti-Î±B1.

(B) Double staining for mutant RUNX1 and PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² reveals that the subunits are colocalized in the cytoplasm within speckled dotlike structures for the missense mutants and a diffuse staining pattern for the frameshift and nonsense mutations. All examples in this figure are in NIH3T3 cells. Original magnification, Ã— 400.While the K83E and R139Q mutations are not within the known NLS, both mutant proteins showed reduced nuclear localization. K83E showed cytoplasmic localization in 30% of transfected cells, in contrast to the normal nuclear localization seen in K83N (a sporadic mutation; Figure 4A).11 This observation may suggest that the K83E mutation (K, positive, hydrophilic, C6; E, negative, hydrophilic, C5) results in greater loss of function than the K83N mutation (N, polar, hydrophobic, C4). The R139Q mutation is at a site involved in DNA binding18 and was expected to affect DNA binding rather than nuclear localization. However, cytoplasmic localization was observed in 40% of cells. The observed defect in nuclear localization in K83E and R139Q is consistent with earlier studies31 and may point to the existence of an additional unidentified N-terminal domain critical for nuclear localization.In contrast to RUNX1, PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² is normally localized in the cytoplasm before heterodimerization32 and can enter the nucleus only with RUNX1.31 However, the regulation of the heterodimerization remains unknown, and it has been shown that both proteins may have different cellular localizations when transfected in the same cells.31 The missense mutants showed speckled dotlike distribution in the cytoplasm, markedly different from the diffuse pattern of the truncated or nonsense mutants. Double staining for the Î± and Î² subunits revealed that they colocalized within these speckled patterns (Figure 4B).Transactivation abilities of the FPD/AML RUNX1 mutantsThe transactivation potential of the mutant RUNX1 proteins was measured using a reporter construct based on the M-CSF receptor promoter as a myeloid-specific RUNX1-target.33 34Wild-type RUNX1 demonstrated more than 100-fold transactivation compared with the FPD/AML mutants, which showed no significant transactivation with or without PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² (Figure5A). Despite the retention of DNA binding activity and C-terminal activation domains, R139Q failed to transactivate. Several mutants showed persistently lower luciferase activities than the mock-transfected plasmid, indicating that these mutants could hinder the function of endogenous RUNX1 in U937 cells. To allow measurement of inhibition of the wild-type transactivational activities caused by the mutant proteins, the reporter construct and a fixed amount of nonsaturating wild-type RUNX1 plasmid were cotransfected with varying amounts of FPD/AML mutant plasmids encoding mutant proteins with DNA and/or PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² binding activity. PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ²-MYH11 and K83N repressed the M-CSF receptor promoter as previously reported.11 35 With the exception of R177X, all of the mutants showed varying degrees of interference with the wild-type protein function in all cell lines tested (U937, HL60, and Jurkat). Most notably, K83E and R174Q showed potent inhibition similar to that of PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ²-MYH11 (Figure 5B). The results of cotransfection reporter assays using frameshift mutants are not reproducible within or between cell lines.Fig. 5.Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFig. 5. Transactivation of the M-CSF receptor promoter by exogenously expressed RUNX1 proteins.(A) Cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid and the indicated RUNX1 expression constructs. Luciferase activities were measured and presented as the fold increase relative to the control transfected with the backbone expression vector. (B) The wild-type RUNX1 and missense RUNX1 mutants were coexpressed in varying doses as indicated. Luciferase activities are expressed as fold changes relative to the activity observed at the standard dose (0.3 Î¼g) of the wild-type RUNX1 alone. (C) PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² was transfected in varying doses with a repressive dose of wild-type and mutant RUNX1 proteins. In panels A-C, each value represents the mean of 3 separate experiments. The luciferase activity of the y-axis in panel C is shown as relative luciferase units (RLU). Deviations of the measurements are given by thin vertical bars. The chimeric protein PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ²-MYH11 and the sporadic mutation K83N were used as controls in each experiment. All examples in this figure are in U937 cells.Because all inhibitory mutants maintained the ability to heterodimerize and all colocalized with PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ², sequestration of PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² by mutant RUNX1 proteins may be the major inhibitory mechanism. To test this hypothesis, PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² was cotransfected in increasing amounts together with inhibitory amounts of mutant RUNX1, resulting in the restoration of near- normal reporter gene activity (Figure 5C).DiscussionFive RUNX1 point mutations and a deletion of the entire RUNX1 gene have previously been described in FPD/AML. Here we report 3 new RUNX1 point mutations associated with the disease. Y260X, in pedigree 3, is at the beginning of the transactivating domain and removes a part of the negative regulatory region for DNA binding.20 31 It is the first described familial RUNX1 mutation outside the Runt domain. As such, the studies described in this paper are not appropriate to test the functional implications of this mutation. Functional analyses of 7 mutants (2 frameshift, 2 nonsense, and 3 missense mutations) were performed to investigate the mechanisms that contribute to FPD/AML, particularly the propensity to develop AML. The capacity to bind DNA was reduced or abolished in all mutant proteins as expected from the sites of substitutions in the Runt domain. The missense and nonsense mutant proteins (largely intact Runt domain) retained the capacity to heterodimerize with PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ². The frameshift mutant proteins, which lack a substantial part of the Runt domain, failed to heterodimerize, as has been reported in a sporadic RUNX1 AML nonsense mutation S114X.11 These observations are consistent with the known crystal structure and predicted binding domain of mouse Runx1. The positions of the 3 missense mutations are not critical for the structural integrity of the dimerization site, whereas the frameshift mutant proteins are predicted to fold abnormally and lack Runt domain residues required for heterodimerization.18Do the mechanisms of pathogenesis of sporadic leukemias provide any clues to the mechanisms of pathogenesis in FPD/AML? In many sporadic hematologic malignancies, the same chromosomal rearrangements consistently appear, supporting the hypothesis that these events are a prerequisite for tumor induction. The somatic mutations acquired in leukemia by translocations and inversions are heterozygous in affected cells; normal copies of the translocated genes are still present. Consequently, the mechanism(s) of disease pathogenesis may include (1) a gain of function by chimeric fusion proteins, (2) haploinsufficiency, (3) a dominant-negative effect of the chimeric fusion proteins, and/or (4) a combination of these mechanisms. However, it is unlikely that the mutations described here have a gain-of-function activity.Haploinsufficiency of RUNX proteinsThe importance of gene dosage to the normal function of CBF transcriptional regulators is seen in the autosomal dominant human bone disorder, cleidocranial dysplasia, caused by mutations inRUNX2 (also called CBFÎ±1).36 37Runx2+/âˆ’ mice show skeletal defects similar to those in cleidocranial dysplasia.38 RUNX2 mutations may be heterozygous missense mutations, insertions, and deletions in either the Runt DNA binding domain or more C-terminal domains responsible for transactivation.39 RUNX2 point mutations are predicted to affect the folding and stability of RUNX2,18 resulting in haploinsufficiency of RUNX2 and defects in bone formation.36 40-43Complete deletion of RUNX1 results in haploinsufficiency in FPD/AML.10 The 2 FPD/AML splice site mutations resulting in frameshifts R135fsX177 and K90fsX101 cause loss of DNA binding, heterodimerization, nuclear localization, and transactivation functions and are also likely to act through simple haploinsufficiency.Dominant-negative effects of mutant RUNX proteins?Translocations involving RUNX1 produce chimeric proteins, most notably RUNX1/AML1-ETO(MTG8) in AML t(8;21) and TEL-RUNX1/AML1 in ALL t(12;21). These chimeric proteins both retain the entire Runt domain and have been shown to interfere with transactivation by the normal RUNX1 in a dominant-negative manner.44-46 RUNX1/AML1-ETO and related fusion proteins have been shown to form complexes with PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² and other nuclear proteins more efficiently than wild-type RUNX1.47-49 Moreover, naturally occurring isoforms of RUNX1 proteins that contain only the Runt domain can also suppress transactivation by full-length RUNX1.50 Deletion of a negative regulatory domain for heterodimerization in the C-terminal region of full-length RUNX1 (amino acids 372-451) results in more efficient heterodimer formation.31 Thus, chimeric RUNX1 proteins resulting from translocations and the isoforms of RUNX1 without the transactivation domain50 may act in the same manner by dimerizing with PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² more efficiently than the wild type.Cotransfection of equal amounts of wild-type and mutant plasmids closely mimics the in vivo situation of one normal and one mutant allele. All FPD/AML RUNX1 missense and nonsense mutants studied, except R177X, show a decrease in their transactivation capacities and an inhibitory effect on wild-type RUNX1 upon cotransfection and thus also seem to act as dominant-negative inhibitors. Both the missense and nonsense mutants still interact with PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ², and both nonsense mutants studied here lack the negative regulatory domain for heterodimerization. R139Q and the 2 nonsense mutant proteins maintain some degree of DNA binding, although the DNA binding of the nonsense mutations may be irrelevant in vivo due to their cytoplasmic localization resulting from a direct disruption of the NLS. The missense mutants, while appropriately translocated to the nucleus most of the time, also show some cytoplasmic staining. The inhibitory nature of these mutants is likely to be due to competition with wild type for dimerization with PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² and its sequestration. In the case of R174X, this must occur in the cytoplasm, whereas for the missense mutations it may occur in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. R177X, which differs from R174X by only 3 amino acids, did not show significant repression of the wild-type RUNX1 in the cotransfection assay and may be considered as haploinsufficient. Structural analysis of the C-terminal end of the Runt domain by nuclear magnetic resonance suggested that this is a region of conformational flexibility.51 R174X, which lacks 3 amino acids in this region, might show decreased flexibility and increased affinity for PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² over R177X. Alternatively, the lack of inhibition by R177X could be due to technical difficulties inherent in the assay, as seen by the inconclusive results observed for the frameshift mutations.One of the notable features of the FPD/AML RUNX1 missense mutants studied here is the colocalization of the RUNX1 and PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² in cytoplasmic speckles, where sequestration of PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² could occur. There is a correlation between colocalization, PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² interaction in vitro, and the level of the inhibitory effect. Because no such pattern was seen with the nonsense and frameshift mutants prematurely terminated within the Runt domain, the presence of the C-terminal region must be required for aggregation of RUNX1 into the speckled cytoplasmic patterns. This raises the possibility that the speckled structures could be the result of C-terminalâ€“associating molecules, which could also be sequestered in the cytoplasm.It was recently shown that dimerization with PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² protects RUNX1 from ubiquitin-proteasomeâ€“mediated degradation, and substitution of K83 to R was shown to increase the half-life of RUNX1 as lysine residues are ubiquitylated.52 Preferential binding of mutant RUNX1 proteins to PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² may increase their half-lives. K83E may be the most potent nonchimeric mutant inhibitor of wild-type RUNX1 described so far because K83 is a residue important for ubiquitinylation.Mice heterozygous for the RUNX1/AML1-ETO or PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ²-MYH11 knocked-ins showed defects in definitive hematopoiesis similar to those observed in Runx1âˆ’/âˆ’ or PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ²âˆ’/âˆ’mice.53 54 Thus, expression of strong dominant-negative inhibitors of RUNX1 seems to produce an embryonic lethal phenotype. The dominant transmission of RUNX1 mutations in FPD/AML implies that strong dominant-negative RUNX1 mutations would also be expected to be lethal. Another study recently showed dominant-negative mutations inCEBPA encoding the C/EBPÎ± transcription factor in sporadic AML. However the dominant-negative effects of the predominantly frameshift mutations described in this study do not have an inhibitory effect by themselves but by increased formation of a secondary protein product by use of a downstream-initiating methionine.55Progression to leukemia in FPD/AMLHaploidy of RUNX1 is clearly sufficient for normal development but possibly insufficient for tumor suppression. Runx1âˆ’/âˆ’mice show a complete lack of definitive hematopoietic cells in the fetal liver, with death occurring from hemorrhages in the central nervous system at 12.5 days after coitus.56Runx1+/âˆ’ mice demonstrate minimal changes in phenotype,56-58 although closer hematologic analysis has revealed a trend for bone marrow progenitor cells to have increased sensitivity to G-CSF, possibly reflecting a propensity to develop myelogenous leukemia.59The presence of biallelic RUNX1 mutations in sporadic leukemias may indicate that RUNX1 functions as a classical tumor suppressor gene.11 13 However, in other cases of sporadic leukemia only monoallelic RUNX1 mutations were described.11 13 Also, in FPD/AML leukemic patientsâ€”one each from the families with the complete RUNX1 deletion and R177X (annotated as R203X by Song et al10)â€”analysis of leukemic cells failed to detect RUNX1 mutations or deletion of the second RUNX1 allele.Two tumor suppressor genes (p53 and p27Kip1) have been shown to be haploinsufficient for tumor suppression in hemizygous mice where the potential complication of dominant-negative mutations can be excluded.60 61 A revision of the Knudson model has been proposed to accommodate haploinsufficiency. The normal level of biologic activity of a tumorigenic gene is tightly controlled, and an increase or decrease in this activity leads to increased tumor susceptibility. In a multiprotein complex or molecular cascade, hemizygous loss of each of 2 (or more) partners or molecules in the same pathway may be almost as tumorigenic as homozygous loss of any one partner.62While mutations in early-acting genes such as RUNX1 predispose to development of hematologic malignancies, the affected lineage and consequent type of malignancy may depend upon which genes subsequently sustain downstream â€œhitsâ€� from additional somatic mutation. For example, combined positivity for antigens CD34, C-KIT, and HLA-DR characterizes the CBF leukemias AML-M2 (RUNX1/AML1-ETO t(8;21)) and AML-M4Eo (PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ²-MYH11 inv(16)).63 C-KIT (CD117) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor for stem cell factor, which is required for normal hematopoiesis. Mutations in C-KIT have been described in various sporadic hematologic malignancies and other diseases.63-67 For example, mutations of residue D816 in exon 17 of C-KIT were detected in 6 of 15 patients with either t(8;21) AML-M2 or inv(16) AML-M4Eo.68It is difficult to make a robust correlation between the type of mutation and the proportion of patients who develop leukemia in FPD/AML families, because of the limited number of individuals identified and a lack of detailed clinical information. It would appear, however, that families with mutations acting simply via haploinsufficiency (deletions and frameshift mutations) show a smaller proportion of affected individuals who develop leukemia than do families transmitting mutations that may act in a dominant-negative fashion (Figure6). This is consistent with the hypothesis that a second mutation has to occur in RUNX1 or other genes to cause leukemia among individuals harboring an inheritedRUNX1 mutation, and these mutations are more likely to occur in the individuals with lower biologic activity of RUNX1. For example, in 2 of the largest FPD/AML pedigrees, a markedly higher rate of leukemia is seen in the family with strong predicted dominant-negative K83E mutation (57%) compared with the pedigree with a complete deletion of RUNX1 (24%).Fig. 6.Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFig. 6. A summary of the FPD/AML RUNX1 mutants and the studies presented in this paper.The FPD/AML RUNX1 mutants are listed in descending order of PEBP2/CBF activity. The Runt and transactivation domains are indicated on the mutant proteins as appropriate. Pedigrees 1 to 6 are from Song et al,10 and A1 and A2 are described in this paper. The results of the EMSA (DNA binding), affinity assay (PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² subunit interaction), subcellular localization, and transactivation studies are summarized. The ratio of leukemic FPD individuals to FPD-affected individuals in each pedigree is indicated on the right. In the largest FPD/AML pedigrees, a markedly higher rate of leukemia is seen in the family with strong predicted dominant-negative K83E mutation (pedigree A1, dominant-negative, 57%) compared with the pedigree with a complete deletion of RUNX1 (pedigree 1, haploinsufficiency, 24%).Thus, we propose that the less functional PEBP/CBF transcriptional regulation complex present in a hematopoietic cell due to variable inhibitory effects of heterozygous mutations, or mutations of both alleles, the higher the propensity to develop leukemia. This mechanism is valid for FPD/AML or sporadic leukemia patients. Clearly, biallelic mutations would be more prone to leukemia development although additional genetic changes may still be required in other genes. Analyses of additional FPD/AML and sporadic leukemia cases with additional clinical and molecular data, including mutation analyses of genes coding for partners of PEBP/CBF or molecules in the same tumorigenic pathway, will help provide evidence for this hypothesis. The RUNX1/AML1 gene is the most frequent target for chromosomal translocation in leukemia. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated point mutations in the RUNX1 gene as another mode of genetic alteration in development of leukemia. Monoallelic germline mutations in RUNX1 result in familial platelet disorder predisposed to acute myelogenous leukemia (FPD/AML). Sporadic point mutations are frequently found in three leukemia entities: AML M0 subtype, MDS-AML, and secondary (therapy-related) MDS/AML. Therapy-related leukemias resulting from anticancer treatments are not uncommon, and the incidence of RUNX1 point mutations appears comparable to the incidence of the t(8;21) AML M2 subtype and the inv(16) AML M4Eo subtype. Half of the point mutations in M0 cases are biallelic, although the frequency varies with ethnicity. Most of the RUNX1 mutations are clustered in the Runt domain and result in defective DNA binding but active beta-subunit binding, which is consistent with three-dimensional structural findings and may explain the dominant inhibitory effects. Unlike the classical tumor suppressor genes requiring biallelic inactivation, haploinsufficient RUNX1 is apparently leukemogenic. However, RUNX1 abnormalities per se are insufficient to cause full-blown leukemia. Intensive investigation of cooperating genetic alterations should elucidate leukemic mechanisms.  Keywords: RUNX, AML1, PEBP2, point mutation, familial leukemia Top of page Introduction Since the discovery of the Philadelphia chromosome, t(9;22), in chronic myelogenous leukemia in 1960, leukemia researchers and physicians have paid much attention to the investigation of chromosomal translocations and resultant chimeric genes. It was also the case for RUNX1/AML1-related leukemia (also known as CBF leukemia, hereafter referred to as RUNX leukemia). Miyoshi et al. (1991) identified AML1 as a gene located on the breakpoint of chromosomal translocation t(8;21) in 1991. Since then, leukemia research on AML1/RUNX1 has been exclusively concentrated on investigating t(8;21) and resultant AML1(RUNX1)/ETO(MTG8); t(3;21), RUNX1/EVI1; t(12;21), TEL(ETV6)-RUNX1; and inv(16), PEBP2beta(CBFbeta)/MYH11. In 1999, Osato et al. (1999) and Song et al. (1999)reported a RUNX1 point mutation in sporadic and familial myeloid leukemia, respectively. Subsequent studies have identified point mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), predominantly in the M0 subtype, in different ethnic groups (Preudhomme et al., 2000; Langabeer et al., 2002; Matsuno et al., 2003; Roumier et al., 2003a, 2003b; Silva et al., 2003). Until recently, mutations were believed to cluster within the Runt domain. However, mutations in the C-terminal region, outside the Runt domain, have also been identified, predominantly in MDS-AML (Harada et al., 2004). Finally, RUNX1 point mutations turned out to occur with comparable frequency to the first mode of RUNX1 alterations, namely, t(8;21), inv(16), and t(12;21), in secondary MDS/AML (Harada et al., 2003). Accordingly, the RUNX1 point mutation is fully recognized as the second mode of leukemogenesis in RUNX leukemia. In this review, I summarize the currently available cases of point mutations and discuss the leukemogenesis mediated by RUNX1+/- status.  Top of page Frequency and distribution of the point mutations The RUNX1 gene consists of 10 exons (exons 1â€“6, 7A, 7B, 7C, and 8) and two promoters followed by the distinct initiation codon in exon 1 and exon 3. The proximal promoter-driven transcript starts in exon 3 and encodes 453 amino acids (aa) (full length 453), whereas the distal promoter-driven transcript from exon 1 encodes 480 aa (full length 480). Full length 480 contains an additional 32 aa instead of 5 aa from the full length 453 in its N-terminal end. Thus, both full lengths share exons 3â€“6, 7B, and 8 and nearly the complete coding sequence. The Runt domain, a highly conserved 128 aa protein motif responsible for both DNA binding and heterodimerization with the beta-subunit PEBP2beta/CBFbeta spans aa 50â€“178 in full length 453 and is located on exons 3â€“5. All RUNX1 mutation-screening studies covered exons 3â€“5, and most included intron sequences flanking the exon. A few studies screened exons 1 and 2 as well, and half of the studies did not cover exons 6â€“8 encoding the C-terminal moiety where the transactivation domain spanning aa 291â€“371 is located. All types of human leukemia, except chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), have been extensively investigated. In addition, a significant number of cell lines, including those established from solid tumors, as well as healthy volunteers were also included in the mutation screenings (Table 1) (Langabeer et al., 2002; Vegesna et al., 2002; Harada et al., 2003; Taketani et al., 2003). A total of 102 cases out of the 1786 tested had a RUNX1 alteration including a point mutation and gene deletion. Most of the nucleotide changes resulted in amino-acid changes with clear functional defects as shown in Figure 1. However, some mutations failed to show any apparent functional alterations, and the nucleotide change may have been constitutive or leukemia specific. Nucleotide changes that do not lead to amino-acid change (synonymous) may generate an abnormal splicing donor or acceptor site, resulting in a nonfunctional protein. These enigmatic cases are listed as &#x27;variation&#x27; in Table 1. The numbers of mutations in Table 1 include variation cases. Most of the mutations are clustered within the Runt domain (Figure 1); N-terminal region, 9 (8.6%); Runt domain, 84 (80.8%); C-terminal region, 11 (10.5%). The total number of mutations (Table 1 and Figure 1) differs (104 vs 102) because the compiled mutants in Figure 1 include 11 cases from FPD/AML, which are not listed in Table 1. Conversely, gene deletion is not included in Figure 1, while a biallelic case in Table 1 provides two distinct mutations simultaneously.  Figure 1.

If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author Full table  Top of page Functional consequence, haploinsufficiency Entire gene deletions and early truncated-type mutations (frameshift or nonsense mutations) were found with significant frequency. Most of the missense mutations also lost their DNA binding and transcriptional activities (Figure 1, right-middle column). Since the majority of cases are heterozygous, haploinsufficiency appears to be a basis for pathogenesis. This notion is most strongly supported by the whole gene deletion in FPD/AML. RUNX1+/- status is likely to provide the cells with a growth advantage to overcome &#x27;selective pressure&#x27; in the subject. However, if this were the only mechanism, mutations would be distributed throughout the gene without &#x27;hot spots&#x27;. Therefore, clustering in the Runt domain suggests that a mechanism other than genuine haploinsufficiency is important for leukemogenesis.  Top of page Dominant negative effect by the retained bold italic beta-binding activity In the Runt domain, eight regions or &#x27;hot spots&#x27; were affected more than twice (Figure 1). Two different mechanisms are probably at least partly responsible. First, the primary sequence of particular sites seems to be preferably targeted by the mutation mechanism. R139, R174, and R177 are encoded by triplets containing CpG dinucleotides, which are extremely prone to transition-type mutations by a mechanism facilitated by methylation of the cytidine residue (Rodenhiser et al., 1997; Yoshida et al., 2003). Second, certain mutation sites are considered to provide cells a stronger growth advantage under &#x27;selective pressure&#x27;. Mapping of the missense mutations strongly supports this notion. Three regions recurrently affected by missense mutations exclusively correspond to three loop-containing regions responsible for DNA binding: betaP1â€“loop(betaP1â€“betaB), betaE&#x27;â€“loop(betaE&#x27;â€“betaF), and betaP2â€“loop(betaP2â€“C-terminus) (Figure 2) (Nagata et al., 1999; Osato et al., 2001; Tahirov et al., 2001). Consequently, these mutants are defective only in DNA binding, and not in packing or heterodimerization (Figure 1), which may explain the dominant negative effects of the RUNX1 mutants. In cotransfection assays, missense and some nonsense mutants showed inhibitory effects towards transactivation mediated by wild-type RUNX1. These mutants bound to PEBP2beta/CBFbeta more efficiently than wild-type RUNX1 (Imai et al., 2000; Michaud et al., 2002). In addition, PEBP2beta protects RUNX1 from ubiquitinâ€“proteasome-mediated degradation (Huang et al., 2001). Thus, preferential binding of mutant RUNX1 proteins to PEBP2beta may in turn increase protein half-life and hence further augment the dominant negative effects. In the right-end column of Figure 1, a general correlation can be seen between the retained beta-binding activity and the inhibitory potential of each mutant. This correlation is more clearly indicated by the comparison of the distribution of missense mutations between RUNX1 and RUNX2 (Figure 2). Germline mutation of RUNX2 causes the bone disease cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) (Mundlos et al., 1997). The missense mutations of RUNX2 distributed throughout the Runt domain affected the overall folding architecture in the cases marked by asterisks in Figure 2, resulting in impairment of both DNA- binding and heterodimerization activity (packing defect). The mutations underlined in Figure 2 showed defects in beta binding alone. In clear contrast, no such mutations resulting in defective packing or beta binding have been found in RUNX1 so far. (Some reported cases are mapped to the residues responsible for packing (suspected cases), but functional analyses have not yet been performed. No suspected case with defect in beta binding alone has been reported.) Conversely, mutations mapping to the first DNA interacting region, betaP1-loop (betaP1-betaB), are seen in RUNX1 but not in RUNX2 (Figure 2) (Yoshida et al., 2003). These RUNX1 mutants, R80C, K83N, and K83E showed strong affinity for the beta-subunit and hence a strong dominant negative effect, suggesting that haploinsufficiency is a dominant mechanism in RUNX2 mutants, whereas a dominant negative effect is important in RUNX1 mutants. Sequestration of the beta-subunit may be one important mechanism of the dominant negative effect caused by the RUNX1 mutants.  Figure 2.

If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author Structural mappings of the missense mutations detected in leukemia or the bone disease CCD. The RUNX1 mutants in leukemia (rectangular outline, orange) are mapped exclusively to the three regions involved in DNA binding, whereas the RUNX2 mutations in CCD (blue) are distributed all over the Runt domain except for the loop (betaP1-betaF). Mutations associated with packing (asterisk) and beta-binding (underline) defects are found only in CCD. Adapted from Nagata et al. (1999)  Full figure and legend (307K)  Top of page The lower the RUNX1 activity, the higher the leukemogenicity How does the dominant negative effect mentioned above relate to leukemogenesis? Although the limited number of individuals and minimal clinical information evaluated prohibit a robust conclusion, families with mutations acting simply via haploinsufficiency have a lower incidence of leukemia than families with mutations acting in a dominant-negative fashion. In two of the largest FPD/AML pedigrees, leukemia occurred at a markedly higher rate in the family with the strong dominant negative K83E mutation (57%) compared to the pedigree with a complete deletion of RUNX1 (24%) (Table 2) (Song et al., 1999; Michaud et al., 2002). Thus, low RUNX1 activity appears to correlate with high leukemogenicity. The hypothesis may be expanded to some extent to leukemogenesis induced by chimeric genes. The majority of current findings indicate that a major function of chimeric genes is a transdominant inhibition of wild-type RUNX1, resulting in severely decreased RUNX1 activity in affected cells. Currently, more than 10 partner genes fused with RUNX1 have been identified in chromosomal translocations. Although each chimeric gene may have its own leukemogenic mechanism, RUNX1 insufficiency may be a common underlying mechanism in RUNX leukemias.

If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author Full table  Acquired trisomy 21 underscores this notion. RUNX1+/- mutant alleles appear to be duplicated frequently. This finding may also lend supporting evidence to the hypothesis that reduced RUNX1 activity increases leukemogenic status. This argument will be discussed later.  Top of page Mutation status â€“ disease phenotype in sporadic leukemias Biallelic mutation and AML M0 subtype RUNX1 point mutations were most frequently found in the AML M0 subtype (Table 1). In addition, 22 of the 39 (56.4%) M0 cases showed the biallelic type of mutation (Table 3). Conversely, only two of the 80 RUNX1 mutation cases in other leukemia subtypes were the biallelic type. Therefore, it is clear that RUNX1 point mutations of the biallelic type are tightly associated with the AML M0 subtype. Mice heterozygous for the RUNX1-MTG8 or PEBP2beta(CBFbeta)-MYH11 chimeric genes showed defects in definitive hematopoiesis similar to Runx1-/- mice, suggesting that the chimeric genes can act as strong transdominant inhibitors of the remaining normal Runx1 allele (Castilla et al., 1996; Okuda et al., 1996; Yergeau et al., 1997). Therefore, the leukemogenic potential of biallelic RUNX1 mutants is considered equivalent to those of chimeric genes. On the other hand, t(8;21), inv(16), and biallelic point mutations are related to the distinct M2, M4Eo, and M0 subtypes of myeloid leukemias, respectively. The different disease phenotypes are quite interesting. The contribution of each partner gene, thought to be considerable, may also be explained by the different residual activities of RUNX1 in the affected adult hematopoietic cells. Conditional Runx1 knockout mice showed apparent defects in hematopoiesis (Ichikawa et al., 2004), whereas hematopoiesis in conditional heterozygous RUNX1-ETO knockin mice was nearly normal (Higuchi et al., 2002), suggesting that Runx1-/- induces more severe effects than the RUNX1-ETO chimeric gene in adult hematopoiesis. The M0 subtype shows minimally differentiated morphology, while the M2 subtype is characteristically well differentiated. Therefore, the differing residual activities of RUNX1 seem to be important. In addition, influence on the activities of other RUNX family genes must be considered because RUNX1-MTG8 or PEBP2beta (CBFbeta)-MYH11 chimeric genes could inhibit RUNX2 and RUNX3 as well, while RUNX1-/- status is a defect in RUNX1 alone. Careful study will resolve this intriguing issue. Table 3 - RUNX1 mutations in AML M0 subtype. Table 3 - RUNX1 mutations in AML M0 subtype - Unfortunately we are unable to provide accessible alternative text for this. If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author Full table  Of note, the biallelic-type mutation is strictly confined to the status with two copies of RUNX1. Biallelic mutation in trisomy 21 is not associated with the AML M0 subtype, but is associated with myeloid malignancies other than M0. This phenotypic difference will be discussed later.  Entire distribution including the C-terminal moiety and MDS-AML/secondary leukemia The RUNX1 point mutations are also frequently found in MDS and subsequent overt leukemia (referred to in this review as MDS-AML) (Tables 1 and 4). The mutations are characteristically distributed, as they were also detected in the C-terminal region which is rarely targeted in other types of leukemias (Harada et al., 2004). Since this distribution was only recently identified, C-terminal mutations were overlooked in a number of previous studies. Half of the studies did not investigate exons 7B and 8 in the C-terminal region. With regard to MDS-AML, the incidence covering both exons 3â€“6 and exons 3â€“8 were evaluated less frequently than those of exons 3â€“8 alone (Table 4). Thus, C-terminal mutations may be underestimated in MDS-AML. However, C-terminal mutations still seem rare in AML, since C-terminal mutations were not identified in the study with a relatively large number of cases. Therefore, RUNX1 point mutations including the C-terminal moiety appear to be found predominantly in MDS-AML. Table 4 - RUNX1 mutations in MDS. Table 4 - RUNX1 mutations in MDS - Unfortunately we are unable to provide accessible alternative text for this. If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author Full table  Harada et al. (2003) from Hiroshima, one of the two cities suffered from atomic bomb, reported two further implications of RUNX1 mutations in secondary MDS or AML (referred to in this review as MDS/AML), including therapy-related and atomic bomb-related MDS/AML. Firstly, the relationship to radiation seems important in terms of the social issue. In addition to the victims in the above two cities, an estimated 220 000 US soldiers and a significant number of local residents and passengers have been irradiated in the aboveground nuclear weapon test sites at Nevada, Bikini atoll, and others in the late 1940s to 1950s. Many of these people are thought to have succumbed to MDS/AML caused by RUNX1 point mutation. Secondly, the involvement in therapy-related MDS/AML seems to have more general impact. With the improvement of treatments for primary cancer, the incidence of therapy-related MDS/AML continues to increase. Therapy-related MDS/AML accounts for roughly 10â€“20% of all new cases of MDS and AML in standard hospitals. Therefore, the incidence of secondary MDS/AML with RUNX1 mutation is comparable to those of t(8;21) AML M2 subtype and inv(16) AML M4Eo subtype (Table 5). Considering its poor prognosis, clinical implication of RUNX1 point mutation in secondary MDS/AML would be rather more significant than we expected.  Table 5 - Estimated frequency of leukemia with RUNX1 point mutation. Table 5 - Estimated frequency of leukemia with RUNX1 point mutation - Unfortunately we are unable to provide accessible alternative text for this. If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author Full table  Leukemic incidence rates were based on several textbooks and public databases from CDC, WHO, and National Cancer Institute (NIH). CLL accounts for 10â€“30%, which may explain the relatively low incidences of t(8;21), inv(16), and t(12;21).  Acquired (not congenital) trisomy 21 and non-MO myeloid malignancy Preudhomme et al. (2000) first reported the relationship between trisomy 21 and RUNX1 point mutation (Table 6). Sporadic cases of myeloid but not lymphoid malignancy with trisomy 21 were associated with a high frequency of RUNX1 point mutations. Taketani et al. (2002) subsequently surveyed RUNX1 mutation in congenital cases of trisomy 21, that is, the Down syndrome-related hematopoietic diseases. However, point mutation in congenital cases appears to be rare except for the enigmatic H58N variation, which has nearly normal function. Allelic analysis of sporadic cases with acquired trisomy 21 showed the following combination: 2â€“3 mutant vs 0â€“1 wild type. The co-occurrence of mutation and trisomy 21 should be associated with the allelic combination with one mutant and two WT combination. However, this combination has never been found. These findings suggest that trisomy 21 increases the copy number of the mutant allele, which already exists in the status of two copies of RUNX1. In other words, trisomy 21 is thought to be a secondary change to RUNX1+/- status. Trisomy 21 as a second hit will be discussed later. Table 6 - Trisomy 21 and RUNX1 mutation. Table 6 - Trisomy 21 and RUNX1 mutation - Unfortunately we are unable to provide accessible alternative text for this. If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author Full table  As mentioned earlier, biallelic RUNX1 mutations are tightly liked to the AML M0 subtype. However, interestingly, acquired +21 carrying a RUNX1 point mutation has never been observed in the AML M0 subtype, even in cases with biallelic mutations (Table 6). This &#x27;discrepancy&#x27; is not explained by the differing residual activities of RUNX1, as half of the M0 cases with RUNX1 mutation are monoallelic. Leukemic phenotype may be determined by an as yet undetermined mechanism.  Top of page Familial leukemia, FPD/AML Heterozygous germline mutation in the RUNX1 gene causes familial leukemia, familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myelogenous leukemia (FPD/AML). A total of 12 pedigrees have been identified so far, mainly in individuals of European descent (Table 2). FPD alone, before the onset of AML, is not fatal but significantly inhibits blood clotting, which could be life threatening after surgery, injury, dental treatment, or childbirth. The incidence of leukemia among affected individuals varies from 20 to 50% (average 35%), and is highest in familial leukemia syndromes including Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome, and Kostman syndrome. The affected subjects seem to develop myeloid malignancies throughout their life span, but not later in life as described in some previous reports. Leukemia developed before the age of 10 years in four of 11 cases. These features of FPD/AML were compared with a similar dominant hereditary disease, Huntington disease (HD). The subjects of HD are healthy until disease onset at 30â€“50 years of age and die 10â€“15 years later. In addition to the low penetrance and/or low severity of symptoms, late onset is a key factor for hereditary disease, since patients often have children before disease symptoms appear. On the other hands, FPD/AML seems detrimental to the subjects in any factors of hereditary disease. How can such a pedigree full of drawbacks exist? FPD/AML may persist as a disease due to the easy-mutability of RUNX1. As discussed before, RUNX1 indeed contains easy-mutable primary sequences: triplets containing CpG dinucleotides extremely prone to transition-type mutations facilitated by methylation of the cytidine residue (Rodenhiser et al., 1997; Yoshida et al., 2003). This mechanism could work particularly well in germ cells. The FPD/AML pedigree may readily disappear in the human population, while a &#x27;de novo&#x27; pedigree could be continually generated with comparable frequency. Consistent with this argument, of CCD cases caused by RUNX2 mutation, approximately half are the &#x27;de novo&#x27; and not the familial type (Zhou et al., 1999). Irradiation readily generates CCD-like phenotypes in mice due to Runx2 alterations. RUNX2 shares the above noted easy-mutable sequences. In the case of RUNX1, healthy British subjects have two kinds of variations: L29S and S21syn with 5 and 3% frequency, respectively (Langabeer et al., 2002). Japanese subjects also have several recurrent enigmatic variations: G42R, I87syn, and H58N. Interestingly, G42R was identified in both leukemia patients and healthy volunteers (Harada et al., 2003; Taketani et al., 2003). These variations, probably including polymorphisms, might reflect the above noted easy-mutability of RUNX1.  As mentioned above, FPD/AML is extremely rare worldwide. Therefore, this clinical entity had been overlooked by physicians until recently. Bone marrow transplantaion was carried out from an affected sibling with mild FPD symptoms to a patient suffering from AML (Buijs et al., 2001). The recipient succumbed to leukemia again, clearly from the hematopoietic cells derived from the donor.  Top of page Genetic alterations cooperating with RUNX1+/- status As mentioned earlier, RUNX1-/- status is frequently found in the AML M0 subtype. Thus, RUNX1 may appear to act as a classical tumor suppressor gene, requiring inactivation of two alleles according to Knudson&#x27;s two hits theory. However, biallelic inactivation is not required in all cases of leukemogenesis; in fact, the overall frequency of biallelic cases is relatively low (27 of 102 cases, or 26%). Biallelic cases of FPD/AML have never been reported. Therefore, RUNX1+/- per se appears to be leukemogenic. The dominant negative effect associated with missense mutations might play a role in leukemogenesis, but not to the same extent as gene inactivation. In any case, heterozygous mutation appears to be a step towards leukemogenesis. Therefore, a mutation in the wild-type RUNX1 on the remaining allele is considered to be a second hit in addition to RUNX1+/- status. Furthermore, acquired but not congenital trisomy 21 is also thought to be a second hit. As discussed earlier, the link between +21 and RUNX1 mutation is interpreted as follows; a mutation takes place in the two copy status and the mutant allele is duplicated in accordance with +21. In both RUNX1-/- and +21 cases, acquirement of another mutant allele is therefore thought to be an additional genetic alteration cooperating with RUNX1+/- status (Figure 3).  Figure 3. Figure 3 - Unfortunately we are unable to provide accessible alternative text for this. If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author Leukemogenesis from Runx1+/-. Biallelic mutations of RUNX1 (RUNX1-/-) are tightly liked to the AML M0 subtype. However, acquired +21 carrying a RUNX1 point mutation (RUNX1+/-/-) has never been observed in M0, despite cases with biallelic mutations. Mutation likely takes place in the two copy status (RUNX1+/-) and the mutant allele is duplicated in accordance with +21, resulting in myeloid malignancies other than M0. FLT-3 mutations were frequently found in M0 cases with RUNX1 point mutations. These genetic alterations are mapped based on such observations  Full figure and legend (55K)  In line with +21, cytogenetics helps to identify second hits. Patients with RUNX1 point mutations show the following concurrent abnormalities; 12 cases showed -7; 6, +8; 5,+13 (Tables 2, 3 and 4). Loss of chromosome 7 is suspected to be a strong predisposing factor for the second hit in RUNX1+/-.  FLT-3 mutations were frequently observed even in monoallelic RUNX1 mutations in M0 patients (Table 3) (Matsuno et al., 2003; Roumier et al., 2003a, 2003b). Hence, the FLT-3 mutation is also a cooperating genetic alteration (Figure 3). FLT-3 mutation results in a constitutively active form known to stimulate cell proliferation. Therefore, differentiation blockade by RUNX1 alteration and growth stimulation by FLT3 mutation would synergistically contribute to a substantial fraction of AML M0 subtype cases. Interesting enough, FLT-3 mutations are known to be rare in the other RUNX leukemias, t(8;21) and inv(16). Certain RUNX leukemias seem to cooperate with distinct second hits. Elucidation of this mechanism might shed light on development of RUNX leukemias.  Top of page Current problems Region for mutation screening As discussed previously, half of the screening studies did not cover C-terminal exons 7B and 8 and therefore overlooked C-terminal mutations in MDS-AML. C-terminal screening is unlikely to reveal information about AML but is recommended. Likewise, exons 1 and 2 might be affected in particular types of leukemia. Theoretically, the promoter and untranslated regions could also be targeted. Variations Significant numbers of variations are reported, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 1. Functional analyses have not yet been performed in all the cases. Each variation must be studied to determine if it is a mutation or a polymorphism. Analyses of polymorphisms might help to characterize susceptibility to leukemia. Dominant negative effect by C-terminal mutants in MDS-AML In the reporter assay, all C-terminal mutants found in MDS-AML showed inhibitory effects in a transdominant manner, like the missense mutants in the Runt domain (Harada et al., 2004). However, similar C-terminal RUNX2 mutations in CCD patients retain partial transactivation activity and show much milder phenotypes compared to the standard CCD phenotypes, which are caused by simple gene deletions (Yoshida et al., 2002). This discrepancy may be due to the distinct cell context or promoter used for the assay. However, a correlation with MDS but not AML might indicate that C-terminal mutants have milder inhibitory effects than Runt domain mutants. The biological assay, but not the reporter assay, may address this issue. Cooperative genetic alterations FLT-3 mutation and +21 are thought to be second hits in MDS/AML with RUNX1 mutations. High frequency of chromosome 7 loss suggests inactivation of the unknown gene on chromosome 7 plays a synergistic role with RUNX1 mutations. However, the overall frequency of these mutations does not account for all cases. Furthermore, to induce a leukemia, three to five genetic alterations are considered to be required based on current evidence. Therefore, a number of genetic alterations must be identified to understand the whole leukemogenic mechanism of RUNX leukemia. My laboratory recently established a mouse system that appears to be quite useful. Myeloid leukemia-prone mice mimicking FPD/AML were generated by backcrossing Runx1+/- onto the BXH2 strain, in which retroviral insertional mutagenesis occurs spontaneously with the eventual development of myeloid leukemia in over 90% of the cases (Li et al., 1999). The proviral integration sites in the leukemias provide powerful genetic tags for disease gene identification. Therefore, collaborating oncogenes with Runx1+/- would be readily detected. Loss-of-function of RUNX1 is widely believed to be the common underlying mechanism of RUNX leukemia. RUNX1+/- status is considered to be the minimum alteration required for several forms of RUNX leukemias. Therefore, the mouse model for FPD/AML mentioned above should be useful for searching for cooperative genetic alterations in the other RUNX leukemias, t(8;21) and inv(16). These genetic alterations identified by the retroviral tagging system might explain the leukemogenic mechanisms not only of RUNX1 point mutations but also of other RUNX leukemias. Top of page Future directions Why is RUNX1+/- status leukemogenic? This question seems to be the most fundamental question not only for RUNX1 point mutation but also all RUNX leukemias. Determining the means by which RUNX1+/- is leukemogenic may not be possible by the currently used approaches to evaluate differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis at the cellular level and transcriptional control at the molecular level. A novel approach is warranted. For example, alteration of &#x27;stemness&#x27; should be investigated in RUNX1+/- status. Stemness could provide cells with a time window sufficient for sequential genetic alterations. Intrinsic molecular functions relevant to leukemogenesis, other than transcriptional control, might be identified by novel approaches.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

    "1. A warning is provided that the columns \"Gene\", \"Text\" and \"Variation\" have high cardinality i.e. there are many distinct values --> this can be problematic in machine learning for two reasons:\n",
    "    - Some algorithms may not tolerate categorical variables. This can be solved by converting these to *n* dummy variables for a categorical variable with length *n* distinct values.\n",
    "    - High cardinality can require high computing resources.\n",
    "2. Despite the high cardinality of \"Gene\", there are some genes that have a high frequency across the dataset. These are expected genes given the cancer context e.g. BRCA1/2, TP53, etc.\n",
    "3. There is an imbalance in the classing of genetic mutations. In balanced system would expect ~11% of data to lie in each class, however, values range from 0.6-28.7% of the data. We will need to bear this in mind, both in terms of splitting out data into training, cross-validation and test, but also in terms of our algorithm.\n",
    "4. Two observations of note with \"Text\" column:\n",
    "    - Distinct count is only 1921, yet there are 3321 rows in this data. I.e. some abstracts are used multiple times (see 'Common values') albeit for different genetic variants.\n",
